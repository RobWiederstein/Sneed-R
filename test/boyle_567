J. BOYLE. This was an action on the case brought by Gaines as executor of Jackson, against Hampton as administrator of Holliday for a deceit alleged to have been committed by Holliday in his lifetime, in regard to the title of a slave sold by him to Jackson. To a declaration against an administrator, for deceit of his testator, plea that the defendant is not guilty, is insufficient, and the issue joined on it immaterial. Hampton, for plea, alleged that "he is not guilty, in manner and form as the plaintiff in his declaration hath alleged;" and upon this plea issue was joined, and a verdict and judgment were rendered thereon for the defendant; to reverse which, the plaintiff prosecutes this writ of error. It is most manifest, that the plea is bad, and that the issue joined thereon is immaterial. The declaration does not allege that the defendant was guilty of the deceit, but that his intestate was; and as the plea only denies that the defendant was guilty, it is plainly not responsive to the allegation. Where the immaterial issue is found for the party who committed the error, and judgment is rendered for him, error lies for the other, to reverse the judgment, that a repleader may be awarded. The judgment is, therefore, erroneous, and must be reversed with costs, and the cause be remanded, that a repleader may be awarded, and further proceedings had, not inconsistent herewith.
