(Cite as: 5 Litt. 38,  15 Ky. 38 (Ky.),  1824 WL 2287 (Ky.)) C Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Stephens v. Tipton. Apr. 9, 1824. *1 FROM THE ESTILL CIRCUIT COURT, THE HON. JAMES CLARK SOLE JUDGE. TURNER and HANSON for plaintiff; CAPERTON for defendant. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY CH. J. BOYLE. It was error in the circuit court to instruct the jury that unless they should be of opinion that the plaintiff had completed the work covenanted to be done by him, by the time stipulated, they must find for the defendant; because the instruction so given assume the covenants of the parties to be dependent covenants, whereas they ought to be construed to be independent, more especially as there had been a partial performance of the covenant on the part of the plaintiff, and the residue admitted of compensation. The failure to perform an independent covenant, will not prevent a recovery from the other party, who has broken his covenant. The judgment must be reversed with costs, and the cause be remanded for a new trial to be had. Ky.App. 1824. Stephens v. Tipton 5 Litt. 38, 15 Ky. 38, 1824 WL 2287 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
