Most Cited Cases A declaration to recover a horse is defective where it fails to describe the horse, either by name, color, size, or any other characteristic mark. Opinion of the Court by Chief Justice BOYLE. THIS was a writ of error to a judgment in an action of detinue for a horse. The declaration contains no description of the horse whatever. He is designated neither by name, color, size, gait, figure, or any other characteristic mark either natural or artificial, by which he can be distinguished from other animals of the same species. Such a general mode of declaring may be sufficient in trespass or trover, where damages only are to be recovered; but in this action, where the thing itself is to be specifically recovered, it is fatally defective. Hence it is that detinue will not lie for money, corn, or the like, unless it be in a bag or sack by which it may be distinguished--Co. Litt. 286 b--3 Black. Com. 152--2 Saun. 74, note 1 b.
