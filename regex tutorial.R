# regular expression functions, there are 7 functions that can use regular
# expression
`?`(grep)
#These functions will look for a certain pattern in the provided string(s), that may be a vector of strings.

# example using grep
words <- c("abc", "Cde", "Truc", "Machin")  #a vector of string
grep("c", words)  #looking for 'C' in each element of the vector, this return the index of the element in the vector containing the pattern ('C')
grep("c", words, value = TRUE)  #same but return the element of the vector containing the pattern
grep("C", words, ignore.case = TRUE)  # by default grep is case-sensitive, can be turned off
grep("[Cc]", words)

# example using grepl
grepl("c", words)  #return a vector of logical

# example using sub and gsub, these two function replace the pattern by a
# replacement value specified by the user
species <- c("Rattus_domesticus", "Formica_rufa", "Germanium_pratense_germanica")
sub("_", " ", species)  #replace the first occurence only.  Look at 3.
gsub("_", " ", species)  #gsub will replace all occurences

# example using regexpr and gregexpr
species <- c("Onthophagus_vacca", "Copris_hispanus", "Carabus_hispanus_hispanus")
regexpr("hisp", species)  #regexpr return the position in the string of the 
                          #first occurence of the pattern as well as the length of the pattern matched
gregexpr("hisp", species)  #gregexpr will return the position of all matched occurence of the pattern
regexec("hisp", species)  #similar as regexpr but with a different output formatting
#As seen in the few examples above when we have a clear idea of what the pattern is that we 
#want to match we can just use it for the pattern argument in the functions. However sometimes 
#we do not know the exact form of the pattern or we want to match at one time 
#several closely related strings, this is where regular expressions come into play. They are an abstracted way to represent the different element (letters, digits, space …) present in the strings.

# the regular expression help page in R
`?`(regex)
#For example: regular expression with 5 different strings
words <- c("Bonjour", "Bienvenue", "Au revoir", "A la bonne heure", "2 heures")
#'\\w' will match any letters (a-z) present in the strings
grep("\\w", words)  #there are letters in all elements of the string

# now if we want to keep only elements having exactly 7 letters we use:
grep("\\w{7}", words)
# we can also match digits using '\\d', space '\\s' and their negation:
# '\\W','\\D','\\S' could you guess what the coming regular expression
# will match?
grep("\\w{2}\\W\\w+", words, value = TRUE)
## [1] "Au revoir"        "A la bonne heure"
# by placing '^' we match from the beginning of the string, similarly $ will
# match the end
grep("^\\w{2}\\W\\w+$", words, value = TRUE)
# a last one using '\\d'
grep("\\d\\W\\w+", words, value = TRUE)
#Several comments, using {n} will look for a string where the item is 
#matched n times, {n,} matched n or more times, {n,m} matched at least n 
#times but no more than m times. We can also use + for matching an item one 
#or more times and * for matching zero or more times. Have a look at 
#?regex where everything is explained in length.


Now I used regular expression most of the time to specifically format labels or species names, this is where gsub in combination woth regular expression become very handy. For exmaple:
  
  # We have three labels with a plot ID BX followed by a genus species
  # information with 3 letters each (Poatri = Poa trivialis), we would like to
  # have the first letter for the genus and the species as upper-case
  species <- c("B1_Poatri", "B2_PlaLan", "B3_lAtPRA")
# in sub and gsub we can put part of the pattern between parentheses to call
# it in the replacement argument
gsub(".{5}(\\w{1}).*", "\\1", species)
## [1] "a" "a" "t"
# now we use the argument perl=TRUE to use the \\U and \\L special
# symbols that set the following letters to upper and lower-case
# respectively
gsub("(.{3})(\\w{1})(\\w{2})(\\w{1})(\\w{2})", "\\1\\U\\2\\L\\3\\U\\4\\L\\5", 
     species, perl = TRUE)
r <- scan ("jesus.txt",
           what = "character",
           skip = 0,
           sep = "\n",
           blank.lines.skip = FALSE)  #interesting
r
grep("d", r)
gregexpr("d", r)
