 THE first error assigned in this case questions the correctness of the opinion of the Court below in admitting to be read as evidence a power of attorney from the plaintiff in that Court to Fores Hunter, without proof of its execution--it not having been, as is alleged, so authenticated as to render it admissible without such proof. Of this point we had at first view considerable doubt, and were inclined to think the objection fatal; but upon a more attentive consideration, we have become convinced of the error of our first impressions, and the correctness of the dicision of the Court below. It appears that the power of attorney was produced by the plaintiff in the Court for the county of Goochland, in the State of Virginia, where he resided, and acknowledged by him as his act and deed, which was ordered by the Court to be certified. The record of this acknowledgment and order is certified and attested by the clerk, with the seal of the Court annexed, and the presiding magistrate certifies that he is clerk of that Court, and that his attestation is in due form. This is in literal conformity with the requisitions of the act of Congress prescribing the mode of authenticating the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of the several States, so as to make them evidence in any other. The only ground upon which we at first entertained a doubt, is, that the power did not appear to have been admitted to record. But this circumstance seems to be immaterial: for the acknowledgement and the order to certify the acknowledgment are of record; which record being authenticated as the law requires, is admissible evidence, and necessarily and conclusively proves the execution of the power. Judgment affirmed with costs and damages.
