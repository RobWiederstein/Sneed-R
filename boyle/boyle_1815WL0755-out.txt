 THIS is a writ of error to a judgment entered upon an award made in pursuance of an order of Court. The plaintiff in error objected to entering judgment upon the award, because the arbitrators had heard evidence in relation to matters not within the submission, and introduced testimony to prove the fact; but it did not appear that such matters were taken into consideration by the arbitrators in making their award, and the Court below overruled the objection. The only question presented by the assignment of error, is, whether the Court decided correctly in overruling the objection to the award? That they did so, we have no doubt. The power of the arbitrators to determine the principal matter submitted to them, necessarily involves the power to decide incidental points in relation to the competency or relevancy of the evidence offered by the parties; and as a misjudgment in respect to the former, would not vitiate their award, so it would not in respect to the latter; for if the award is conclusive as to the principal matter of controversy, it must necessarily be so as to incidental points. Had the award indeed purported to decide matters not submitted to the arbitrators, it would not have been binding upon the parties. But that is not the case here; for the award purports only to have determined the matters submitted. And if in making their award the arbitrators have been influenced by irrelevant evidence, it is an error of judgment only, to which the parties must submit. Judgment affirmed with costs.
