Most Cited Cases A declaration in detinue should not allege a tortious taking by a third party, nor a detention by such third party, as well as the defendant. Opinion of the Court by Chief Justice BOYLE. *1 THIS was an action of detinue for a slave. The declaration is not liable to the objections taken to the declaration in the case of Price v. Israel, but it is furthermore objectionable in not alleging either property or possession in the plaintiff. It avers indeed that the plaintiff was in right of his wife possessed of the mother of the slave in contest; but it does not follow as a necessary conclusion of either law or fact, that he owned or possessed the child; nor is their any other fact alleged from which such an inference can be deduced. Declaration in detinue defective in not alleging either property of possession in the plaintiff. The judgment must be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded that the plaintiff may have leave to amend and proceed de novo. Ky.App. 1814. Morton v.
