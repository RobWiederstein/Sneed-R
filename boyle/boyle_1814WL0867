OPINION OF THE COURT, BY CH. J. BOYLE. This is a writ of error to a judgment for the plaintiff, in a traverse of an inquisition finding the plaintiff in the traverse guilty of a forcible entry upon a ferry, &c. Neither a writ of forcible entry and detainer nor ejectment will lie for a ferry. The only question which is deemed material to be decided, is, whether a warrant for a forcible entry will lie for forcibly taking possession of a ferry, and the banks and shores of a river, where the party so taking possession has a right of ferry established. We are of opinion it will not lie in such a case. A ferry is of that description of property, which, in technical language, is denominated incorporeal, and which in legal consideration is not tangible. Like a right of way or of common, or other incorporeal right, no entry in point of fact, can in strict propriety be said to be made upon it; nor could the sheriff, in case of a judgment of restitution, deliver possession. In such a case an ejectment would not lie, and upon the same principle a warrant for a forcible entry would not. See Chitty on Plead. 188, and the authorities there cited. The use of the banks or shores, is a necessary incident to the ferry, and is virtually included in, and composes a part of the right of ferry, and must, therefore, as an incident, follow its principal. Judgment affirmed with costs. Ky.App. 1814. Rees v. Lawless Litt.Sel.Cas. 184, 16 Ky. 184, 1814 WL 867 (Ky.), 12 Am.Dec. 295 END OF DOCUMENT
