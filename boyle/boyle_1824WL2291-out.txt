 This is a writ of error to a judgment for the defend??, upon a demurrer to the declaration in an action ?? covenant. The declaration undoubtedly contains ?? necessary averments to make out a good cause of ??ion against the defendant; but the action was ??ught against him alone, and it appears from the cov??nt declared on, of which oy??er was granted, that ??ob Crimm was a joint covenanter with the defend??, and it is supposed that the failure to sue him ?? tly with the defendant, is the ground upon which ?? demurrer to the declaration was sustained. But ?? ground is clearly untenable. Most clearly, all the ??t contractors ought to be joined in an action upon a ??tract, whether it be by parol or by specialty; but it is well settled, that where one or more of severa?? joint contractors are sued, without sueing the others?? advantage can be taken of it only by plea in abatemen?? 1 Saunders 154, note 1; ibid 291, note 4. Where one or more of several joint contractors are sued, without joining the others, advantage can not be taken of it by demurrer; it can be done only by plea in abatement. The judgment reversed with costs, and the cause ?? manded, for further proceedings to be had, not inco?? sistent herewith. Wickliffe, for plaintiff; Haggin, for defendant.
