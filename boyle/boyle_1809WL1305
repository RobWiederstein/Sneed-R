(Cite as: 1 Bibb 460,  4 Ky. 460 (Ky.),  1809 WL 1305 (Ky.)) Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Humphreys v. Brown. Jun. 13, 1809. *1 See case. Opinion of the Court by Judge BOYLE. TO AN action of covenant, the appellant, who was defendant in the Court below, pleaded covenants performed, on which issue was regularly taken by the parties. Having pleaded also a second plea, and a special replication being made thereto by the plaintiff, the defendant demurred to the replication, but the Court overruled the demurrer, and gave judgment for the plaintiff for his damage, to ascertain which a writ of inquiry was awarded and executed; and for the damages found by the jury, a final judgment was rendered by the Court. This was clearly erroneous; a jury should have been empanneled and sworn to try the issue joined upon the plea of covenants performed; and no final judgment ought to have been rendered for the plaintiff, unless that issue had been decided against the defendant. Judgment reversed. Ky.App. 1809. Humphreys v. Brown 1 Bibb 460, 4 Ky. 460, 1809 WL 1305 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
