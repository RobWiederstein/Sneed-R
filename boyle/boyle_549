There are in this case several irregularities in the proceedings in the court below, for which the decree for the complainants must be reversed. In the first place, there are some of the persons who were made defendants in the bill, and were necessary parties to the suit, being alleged to have an undivided interest in the property in controversy, upon whom there appears to have been no service of process, and who did not appear and answer. Decree for complainants reversed, because some of the defendants alleged to have an interest in the property in contest, were neither summoned nor appeared, and because there was no order of court appointing guardian ad litem, the person who answered for infants. And in the next place, there are some of the defendants, for whom, as infants, a person styling himself their guardian, has answered; but there is no order in the record filed, appointing the person who has so answered, guardian ad litem; and without such an order, he could have no right to answer for them. The decree must be reversed with costs, and the cause be remanded, for new proceedings to be had, not inconsistent herewith. Triplett, for complainants. Ky.App. 1824. Shields v.
