 IT is objected by the assignment of error in this case, that the names of the plaintiffs in the Court below are not contained in the declaration, or any of the subsequent proceedings. This being a judgment by default FN(a), does not come within the provisions of the statute of jeofails of 1799. The act of jeofails of 1796, cures a mistake in the christian or surname of either party, the name being right in any part of the record or proceedings. FN(a). Vide, acc. Collins v. Gibbs, 2 Burr., 899. The names of the plaintiffs in this case are expressed in the writ; and if the objection now made were of a nature to be cured by the last mentioned statute, we could have no hesitation in saying that the writ is a part of the record, and that the defect complained of would be unavailing. But this statute is evidently confined to mistakes in the christian or surname, and does not extend to a total absence of both.--Judgment reversed. Want of both christian and surname of plaintiff not cured by statute of jeofails.
