Most Cited Cases Where land has been devised to several persons jointly, and the right of entry is barred by the statute of limitations, one of the joint devisees cannot avoid the statute by showing that at the time the right of action accrued he was not a resident of the commonwealth. CHIEF JUSTICE BOYLE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This was an action of ejectment. A joint demise by Robert Armstrong, James L. Armstrong, John Armstrong, and William Armstrong, is laid in the declaration. After issue had been joined, and a verdict for the plaintiff, the parties made an agreed case, from which it appears that a patent from the commonwealth, bearing date the         day of         issued to Robert Armstrong for the land in controversy. That Robert Armstrong departed this life on the 26th of April, 1811, having previously made and published his last will in writing, whereby he devised the said lands to the lessors of the plaintiff. That the said devisees were, at the death of their testator, above the age of twenty-one; and that James L. Armstrong, one of said devisees, at and prior to the death of the testator, and ever since, has been a resident of the state of Tennessee: That the defendants have title under grants from the commonwealth, of younger date than the patent of Robert Armstrong, and that they settled under such title in the year 1794, and have ever since resided thereon, a period of more than twenty years befofre the commencement of this suit. The parties agreed, that if upon this case the law was in whole or in part for the plaintiff, judgment should be rendered upon the verdict accordingly; and that if the law was for the defendants, the judgment should be entered for them, notwithstanding the verdict. The court below being of opinion that the law was for the plaintiff, as to one undivided fourth part, gave judgment accordingly, from which this appeal is prosecuted. Whether the statute of limitations operates as a bar to the plaintiff's recovery, in whole or in part, is the main point which the case presents. As the defendants were admitted to have been in possession under an adverse claim for more than twenty years prior to the commencement of the action, it is clear that the statute which prohibits the entry of any person into land but within twenty years next after the right accrued, must be a bar to the recovery, unless the lessors of the plaintiff, or part of them, be within some one of the exceptions of the statute. Whether this is the case or not, must depend upon the construction which ought to be given to the language used in the statute. *2 In a joint estate to several persons, if the right of entry is tolled as to some, all are barred. After the enacting clause, it is provided--"That if any person or persons entitled to such writ or writs, or such right or title of entry, as aforesaid, shall be or were under the age of twenty-one years, feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned or not within this commonwealth, at the time of such right or title accruing, or coming to them, every such person, and his or her heirs, shall, notwithstanding the said twenty years are or shall be expired, bring and maintain his action, or make his entry within ten years next after such disabilities removed, or death of the person so disabled, and not afterwards." Aliter as to a tenancy in common. The opinion of the court below seems to have been predicated upon the idea that the absence of one of the lessors of the plaintiff, from the commonwealth, brought him within this clause, notwithstanding the other lessors of the plaintiff, did not appear to be within any of the exceptions it contains. This idea would have been correct, no doubt, if the devise to the lessors of the plaintiff had been of an estate in severalty, or in common, for in either of these cases, their right or title would have been several, and each of them might have maintained his several action. But as the devise is admitted to have been made to them in general terms, without any modification or restriction, we must assume the estate they took to be a joint one, and consequently that their right or title is joint. It would seem, therefore, that to bring any one of the lessors of the plaintiff, within the influence of the clause before recited, the others must also be shewn to be within some of the exceptions it contains. For the right to bring an action, or make an entry, after the expiration of twenty years, is granted only upon the condition that the person or persons entitled to such action, or such right of entry, shall labor under some of the disabilities mentioned; that is, if any person is entitled, where there is but one having a several right or title; or if any person entitled, where there is a plurality of persons having the title, be within some of the exceptions mentioned, in such case, and not otherwise, is the right of action or right of entry saved. The expression, "if any person or persons entitled, &c., were or shall be under the age of one and twenty years, &c." is in point of grammatical propriety, susceptible of no other construction. Besides, upon any other construction, the term "persons" in the plural after the expression "any person" in the singular number had been used, would be nugatory and inoperative; and it is a rule in the exposition of a statute, that it shall be so expounded that not only every clause, but every word, shall have some operation and effect. In fortification of this construction we may remark, that the saving in the statute in relation to personal actions, is couched in similar language, and that the supreme court of the United States has given to it the same exposition which we have to the clause under consideration:  7 Cranch, 156. A majority of the court are therefore of opinion, that on this ground the judgment of the circuit court is erroneous. *3 Judge Logan, who dissents from the foregoing construction of the statute, concurs, however, with the circuit court in the opinion, that the right only of the lessor, who labored under a disability, was saved, and that the right of the others was tolled by the statute. And, according to this construction, we are all of opinion, that the judgment should have been entered on the agreed case for the defendants; for as the right is only shewn to have been in one, he could not recover upon a joint demise with others having no right.--Running upon Eject. 221-2. In a joint demise by several, all must have a right of entry, or none can recover. Judgment reversed with cost, and the cause remanded, that judgment may be entered for the defendants.
