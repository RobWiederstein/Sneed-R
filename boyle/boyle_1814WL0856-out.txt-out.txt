 *1 THE judgment in this case was rendered upon a demurrer to evidence tendered by the defendant, in which the evidence given on both sides is stated. This we apprehend cannot regularly be done.FN(a) The defendant could not by demurring cause his own evidence to be taken for true, and the Court cannot without usurping the province of the jury decide upon its truth. In principle it is not less absurd for a party to demur to his own evidence, than it would be to demur to his own plea; and it is believed that there is no precedent to be found in the English books for the former, no more than there is for the latter practice. FN(a). Vide Hoyle v. Young 1 Wash. 151. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded that a venire facias de novo may be awarded, etc.
