 THIS is a writ of error to a judgment of the Court below overruling a motion to quash an execution which issued upon a decree dismissing a bill filed by the plaintiff in error against the defendant with costs. The motion to quash was made upon the ground that the clerk had taxed a lawyer's fee for each defendant. That this may be correctly done, in some cases, we have no doubt.--Whether it was properly done in this instance, is however, unnecessary to be decided: for if it was not allowable, it was a clerical misprision, as was held in the case of Hubbard v. Hite, [fall term, 1814.] and is amendable upon a motion for that purpose, but forms no ground for quashing the execution. The motion to quash the execution was correctly overruled. Judgment affirmed with costs.
