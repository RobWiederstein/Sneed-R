 Judge WALLACE absent. Two points are made in this case. 1. Whether in an action of covenant upon a general warranty, the value of the land with its improvements at the time of eviction, is the proper measure of damages? 2. Whether where the vendee has purchased in the right of the successful claimant, evidence of what he had given is admissible, for the purpose of reducing the quantum of recovery in an action upon the covenant of warranty? The first point was decided in the negative, in the case of  Cox's heirs v. Strode (5 Ky. 273). The doctrine there settled, has been repeatedly recognized in many subsequent cases, and is now two well understood to require any comment. The second point is entirely new, and at first view presented some difficulty, but upon further reflection we think the evidence inadmissible. Without deciding whether in equity the vendee would be a trustee for the vendor, so far as to authorize the latter to avail himself of the advantages of the purchase from the successful claimant, we can have no doubt that at law he cannot be so considered; and in an action at law upon the covenant of warranty, a mere equity cannot be an admissible ground of defense. Beside, the evidence of an extraneous matter of this kind, is calculated to take the adverse party at surprise, and on that ??ccount is extremely objectionable. The Court below therefore, decided correctly in rejecting the evidence of what the vendee had given to the successful claimant, but erroneously admitted proof of the value of the land with its improvements, at the time of eviction.-- Judgment reversed, etc.
