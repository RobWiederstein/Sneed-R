 THIS is an appeal from a judgment for the plaintiff in an action of ejectment. The points made by the assignment of error evidently merit but very little of consideration. The only one which is at all relied on, is, that notice should have been given to the defendant to quit the possession before the action was brought. Where the defendant holds the premises as tenant to the plaintiff, it is in some cases necessary to give notice to quit possession, in order to maintain an ejectment; but in this case the defendant does not hold as tenant to the plaintiff. The only evidence which he exhibited of his title, was a deed in fee for the land in controversy, from the late husband of the plaintiff, to which she was no party; and she makes title to the land, not under her husband, but in her own right. To say, therefore, that he was her tenant would be a total perversion of the term. It would be using it in a sense wholly unwarranted, according to either its technical or popular acceptation. But were it admitted, as it was supposed in the argument, that he was tenant at sufferance, still we apprehend notice would not have been necessary in this case; for the doctrine requiring notice applies peculiarly to tenants at will, or as they are now more usually called, tenants from year to year; but where a lessee's term expires at a fixed period, and he holds over, in which case he becomes a tenant at sufferance, notice is not necessary--Run. Ejec. 92 and 102. As to the point in relation to the refusal of the Court below to appoint commissioners to value the improvements, it seemed to be abandoned in the argument, and no doubt correctly. The case clearly does not come within the provisions of the statute concerning occupying claimants; and the appointment of commissioners for such purpose in an action at law, is a proceeding unknown to the common law. The judgment must be affirmed with costs.
