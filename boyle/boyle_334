Parties. Most Cited  Cases The statute subjecting land of a deceased to the payment of his debts only makes the heir liable in an action brought against him and the executor or administrator;  and hence an action on a covenant of warranty in a deed executed by the decedent cannot be brought against the heir alone, but the executor or administrator must be joined. Opinion of the Court by Chief Justice BOYLE. Judge OWSLEY absent. THIS was an action brought by the defendant in error against the plaintiffs, as heirs of David Lawrence, deceased, upon a covenant of warranty contained in a deed of bargain and sale executed by him in his lifetime to the defendant. The declaration not having alleged that the heirs were named or bound in the deed, is fatally defective; for where the heir is not named in the deed, he is not liable at common law; and the statute subjecting lands to the payment of debts, only makes him liable in an action brought jointly against him and the executor or administrator. This action not having been so brought, the judgment is consequently erroneous.--See the case Lawrence's heirs v. Buckman (vol. 3, p. 23). Judgment reversed with costs. Ky.App. 1815.
