 *1 THIS was an action of debt upon a bond with a collateral condition. Judgment was taken by default, and without setting forth the condition or any part thereof, breaches were assigned, for which damages were assessed by the verdict of the jury, upon a writ of inquiry for that purpose. That in a case of this kind it is necessary to set forth in substance, so much of the condition of the bond as will be sufficient to show that the breaches suggested are of covenants contained in the condition, and properly assigned, was decided in the case of Bibb v. Morton (spring term, 1810). That decision turned solely upon this point and seems abundantly supported by authorities (See 1 Saund., p. 58, note 1). Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for new proceedings, etc.
