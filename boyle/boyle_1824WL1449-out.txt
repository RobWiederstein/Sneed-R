 Although the writ in this case had issued against one defendant alone, yet it was erroneous to render judgment against him only, when the declaration was jointly against him and another, upon a joint contract by both; and as the plaintiff, having stated his whole cause of action against both, would be barred by the judgment against one, from maintaining his action against the other, he is thereby prejudiced, and though the judgment is for him, he may well bring his writ of error to reverse it. In a declaration against two persons who are jointly bound, if the writ issues against one only, and judgment is rendered against him alone, it will, for that cause, be reversed, at the instance of the plaintiff. The judgment must be reversed with costs, and the cause be remanded, that the suit may be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff there.
