 *1 THIS is a writ of error to a judgment in a scire facias upon a recognizance of special bail. The error assigned is, that there was no capias ad satisfaciendum taken against the principal, before the issuing of the scire facias. This would have been a good plea in the Court below, but is not an admissible objection in this Court; for the proceedings in the original action do not compose a part of the record in the scire facias, unless they had been made so by oyer or otherwise; and that which is not apparent upon the face of the record, is not assignable for error--See Russell v. Hart, Pr. Dec. 365, and the authorities there cited.--Judgment affirmed, etc.
