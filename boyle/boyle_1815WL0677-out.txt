 THIS is a writ of error to a decree for the specific execution of a contract for the sale of land. The contract alleged in the bill, though verbal, is not, as is supposed by the assignment of error, within the statute against frauds and perjuries.FNa1 The contract appears to have been made in 1786, and that statute did not go into operation until the 1st of January, 1787. FNa1. Accord. Johnson v. M'Connel, vol, 3, p. The decree, however, is erroneous upon two grounds--1. Because it was pronounced against infants, and no time was allowed them after coming of full age to show cause against it; and 2. Because the person answering for them does not appear to have been appointed to defend for them; and infants can only defend by guardian appointed ad litem, as was held in the case of Shield's heirs v. Bryant (vol. 3, 525). As, however, the contract is not within the statute against frauds and perjuries, and the bill makes out upon its face a good cause for relief, the complainant will be entitled to proceed anew upon it in the Court below.
