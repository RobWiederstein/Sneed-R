 *1 THIS was an action of covenant. The defendant pleaded--1. Non infregit conventionem; 2. A tender; and 3. An accord and satisfaction. Upon each of which pleas issue was joined, and the jury upon the trial thereof returned a verdict "that the defendant hath not broken his covenant in manner and form as the plaintiff in her declaration hath alleged." The Court thereupon gave judgment against the plaintiff for costs; to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted. In covenant, the plea of non infregit, to an affirmative covenant, and issue thereon, is not immaterial, but cured by verdict: it would have been bad upon demurrer. If executor or administrator sues for breach of covenant in lifetime of decedent, no judgment for costs is given against the executor or administrator--Vide acc. Sayer on costs, 94 to 102, ch. XIII--Ld. Ray. 1414, Portman v. Cane--S. C. Stir. 682, Elwes' ex'r v. Mocata--Ld. Raymon. 865-6 Mod. 93--Salk. 208, Jenkins et ux v. Plume--3 Burr. 1586--Hawes' ex'x v. Saunders. The errors assigned are--1. That the first plea, to which alone the verdict responds, is immaterial and not replied to; and 2. That the judgment for costs is erroneous. The first error cannot be sustained. The plea of non infregit conventionem, cannot with propriety be said to be immaterial. It is true that it would have been bad upon demurrer, but it is cured by verdict-- Chitty's Pleadings, 482--Com. Dig. Pleader, (2 U) 5. No replication was necessary to make an issue upon the plea: it was general, and in the negative and concluded to the country. The second error assigned is well founded. The action was brought upon a covenant made to the plaintiff's intestate, and the breach is alleged to have happened in his lifetime. In such case no judgment can be given for costs against an executor or administrator. The judgment, therefore, as to costs, is erroneous. It is therefore considered by the Court that the judgment of the Circuit Court as to costs be reversed with costs.
