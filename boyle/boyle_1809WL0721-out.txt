 The Chief Justice absent. THE errors assigned in this case are such as are either cured by the statute of jeofails, or are not apparent upon the face of the record. The first consisting of a variance between the writ and declaration, and the second of a want of profertFNa1 of the deed alleged by the replication to have been tendered, are manifestly cured by the statute of jeofails. The third, which alleges that the writing declared on, is not under the seals of the said Marshall and Bohannon, does not appear to be predicated upon the record; the declaration avers, that the writing declared on, was sealed and delivered by them, and we cannot notice any variance between the allegation and the writing proffered, unless, by praying oyer of it, it had been spread upon the record.FNa2 FNa1. This was after issue joined and verdict. The want of profert is bad upon demurrer, or after judgment by default, without writ of inquiry executed.  Scott v. Curd, Hard. 64; Simons v. Alexander, Gilbert's Rep. 237; Thoresby v. Sparrow, 2d Strange 1186; 2d Wilson 16; Bull. N. P. 249-253. The true distinction as to supplying defects, is Whether the objection be taken after verdict or not. Motion in arrest of judgment by default, comes before the Court exactly as if upon demurrer. Collins v. Gibb, 2d Burr. 899. FNa2. Adams v. Macey, next case: Ralston v. Love, Har. 505;  Adams v Bradshaw Hard. 555. The fourth and last error assigned is founded upon the supposed validity of those which preceded, and as the foundation has given way, the superstructure of course must fall.--Judgment affirmed.
