 Judge CLARKE absent. *1 THIS was an action of debt, in which the plaintiff declared upon an obligation which is alleged to have been sealed by the defendant's testator. On oyer, the obligation appearing to have been made jointly by the testator and another, the defendants demurred, but the demurrer was overruled, and final judgment given by the Court for the debt in the declaration mentioned; from which judgment the defendants appealed to this Court. It is a general rule, that all joint obligors or contractors must be made defendants, and the plaintiff may be compelled to join them all, if the omission be taken advantage of in due time, and by a proper plea. But it is well settled, that where an action is brought upon a joint deed or contract, against part only of the co-obligors or contractors, the matter must be pleaded in abatement, and cannot be taken advantage of upon any other plea, or in any other manner FN(a) --See the case of Cabell v. Vaughan, 1 Saund. 291, and Williams' note 4, to that case. The objection taken in this case, to rendering final judgment on the demurrer, without awarding a writ of inquiry, is so obviously untenable that it does not deserve to be noticed. FN(a). In another case between the same parties, it was decided (the same ??y) that this matter could not avail upon a motion to exclude the bond from going in evidence to the jury, for the supposed variance between the bond and declaration. The judgment affirmed, with damages and costs.
