 This is an appeal taken on the part of the Commonwealth, from a judgment of the county court of Henry county, acquitting the appellee of a charge of bastardy. An appeal does not lie in favor of the commonwealth from a judgment of a county court, acquitting a defendant on a charge of bastardy. The appeal, we are of opinion, does not lie. The act establishing the court of appeals, expressly declares that no appeal shall be granted from the judgment or decree of an inferior court, to the court of appeals, unless the judgment or decree amounts, exclusive of costs, to thirty pounds, or relates to a franchise or freehold. I Dig. L. K. 381. The judgment here, can not, with any propriety, be said to amount to thirty pounds; for there was no definite sum claimed, and it depended upon the discretion of the county court, what sum should be awarded against the appellee, in case he was found guilty of the charge; and it is perfectly clear, that the judgment does not relate to a franchise or freehold. The appeal, therefore, can not lie, unless there be some other law to authorize it, and we know of none such. In cases of bastardy, it is discretionary with the county court what sum the defendant shall pay. The only cases, so far as we can find, in which the commonwealth has any peculiar privilege granted in relation to her right of appeal, are the cases of judgments upon writs of mandamus, and it can not be pretended that this is a case of that character. The appeal was, therefore, improvidently granted, and must be dismissed.
