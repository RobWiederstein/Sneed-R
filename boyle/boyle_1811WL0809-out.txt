 *1 THE only question in this case is, whether where the plaintiff in ejectment declares for a several interest in the whole land in controversy, he will, on showing himself entitled to an undivided part have a right to recover pro tanto? This question occurred in the case of Davis v. Whiteside (vol. i, 513), and was decided in the affirmative. That decision seems to be fully warranted by the authorities there cited and relied on--See Burges v. Perries, 1 Burrows 326-- Ablett v. Skinner, 1 Siderf, 229. The instructions therefore given by this Court to the jury in this case, that the plaintiff on evidence of title to an undivided third was not entitled to a verdict for so much, is erroneous. Wherefore it is considered by the Court, that the judgment of the Circuit Court be reversed, that the verdict of the jury be set aside, and that the cause be remanded to said Court for new proceedings to be had therein, not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion, etc.
