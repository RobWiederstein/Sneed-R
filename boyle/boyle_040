Most Cited  Cases (Formerly 371k845) An order for a summons, and the summons consequent thereon, requiring defendant to show cause why he should not be fined, and which is silent as to the treble tax, will not support a judgment imposing a fine and a treble tax for refusing to give a list of property to the county commissioner. Opinion of the Court by Judge BOYLE. THIS writ of error is prosecuted to reverse a judgment of the County Court imposing a fine and treble tax upon M'Call for refusing to give a list of his billiard table to the commissioner of the county, when called upon for that purpose, for the years 1807 and 1808. The order for the summons, and the summons consequent thereon, only require him to show cause why he should not be fined, and is silent as to the treble tax. In this respect the proceedings are variant from the mode prescribed by the law; which, being penal, must be literally and strictly pursued. The order and the summons are therefore erroneous; nor do they support the judgment of the Court, which is as well for the treble tax as for the fine. Judgment reversed. Ky.App. 1809. McCall v.
