Most Cited Cases One of two co-obligors filed his bill for relief from a judgment at law, on the ground that the bond was usurious.  Held, that the other ought to have been made a party, or good reason suggested why he was not. Opinion of the Court by Chief Justice Boyle. THIS is a writ of error to a decree enjoining a judgment at law, upon the ground that the judgment was obtained upon an obligation given for an usurious consideration. The bill was filed by only one of two co-obligors, and the other is not made a party, either complainant or defendant, nor any reason suggested why he was not. The decree is on this ground, therefore, clearly erroneous; for if one co-obligor may in such a case file a bill, another might, and suits be thus multiplied equally contrary to the maxims of sound policy and to the principles which govern a Court of Equity. The decree reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for new proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion. Ky.App. 1815. Macey v. Brooks 4 Bibb 238, 7 Ky. 238, 1815 WL 744 (Ky.)
