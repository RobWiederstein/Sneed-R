 THIS was an action of assumpsit, brought by Shepherd against Brown and Brooks, for money laid out and expended by him to their use. Judgment was taken by default against Brown, and a writ of inquiry awarded as to him. Brooks pleaded non assumpsit, upon which issue was joined. On the trial the plaintiff produced in evidence a record of the proceedings in a suit brought by Prather and others against Brown, from which it appeared that Prather and others had obtained a judgment against Brown on a note executed by him; on which judgment an execution issued, and was returned with a three months replevin bond, executed by Brown, and Brooks as his security: that an execution having issued upon the replevin bond, the sheriff returned that he had taken the property of Brooks, which was not sold for want of bidders: that a venditioni exponas was issued thereon, and the sheriff returned that Brown had replevied for twelve months, with Shepherd his security; and that Shepherd, in virtue of the execution issued on the twelve months replevin bond against him and Brown, was compelled to pay the money. This being all the evidence produced on the part of Shepherd, Brooks demurred; and on the demurrer the Court gave judgment for Shepherd: and a writ of inquiry being executed, a final judgment was given for the damages assessed by the jury against Brooks and Brown; to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted. We have no doubt that the Court below erred in giving judgment against Brooks. The debt was not his, nor does it appear that he was under any moral obligation to discharge it; and the legal obligation which he had incurred by becoming security to Brown in the first replevin bond, was released by the execution of the second replevin bond, in which he was not bound. So that being under no obligation, either legal or moral, to pay the debt when the money was advanced by Shepherd, it cannot in any sense of the word be said to have been laid out and expended to his use. *2 The judgment must therefore be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded that judgment may be entered upon the demurrer to evidence for Brooks, and a separate judgment entered against Brown for the damages assessed by the jury.
