Opinion of the Court by Chief Justice BOYLE *1 THE person on whose information a prosecution upon a recognizance to keep the peace has been instituted, is not required by law to be made a party to the prosecution, nor subject to pay the costs upon the failure of the prosecution. It seems therefore, that Ashby was unnecessarily made a party in the writ of error and ought not to be subject to the payment of costs. Wherefore it is considered that the former judgment of this Court, so far as it relates to the costs, be annulled and set aside, and that, in other respects, it stand unaltered and affirmed.
