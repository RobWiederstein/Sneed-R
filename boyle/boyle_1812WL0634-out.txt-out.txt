 THIS was an action of debt, upon a note for the payment of "eighty-nine dollars, to be discharged in good merchantable brick, common brick at four dollars per thousand, and sand brick at five dollars per thousand, to be delivered at the house of said Craig, in the town of Shelbyville, on or before the first day of August next." The defendant failing to appear, judgment was taken by default against him; to which he prosecutes this writ of error. The only question is, whether an action of debt will lie in this case? It is a settled doctrine of the common law that debt will not lie upon a contract for the delivery of property or the performance of any other duty except the payment of money. This doctrine has been recognized by the decisions of this Court in the cases of Watson and M'Call v. M'Nary, (vol. i, p. 356) Bruner v. Kelso (vol i, p. 487.) In principle we can perceive no difference between these cases and the one before the Court. In either case the sum mentioned is not the thing to be paid, but is merely the medium by which the value or quantity of the thing contracted to be paid is to be ascertained. The expression "to be discharged in good merchantable brick," etc., cannot be construed as was contended in argument to give an election to the debtor to pay in bricks or not, as might suit his convenience, but plainly imports an imperative obligation. The same phraseology is used in the stipulation with respect to the place and time of the delivery of the bricks, yet no one can doubt that it was not the intention of the parties that the debtor should have an election to deliver them when and where he pleased. We are therefore of opinion that the action was misconceived, and consequently that the judgment is erroneous, and must be reversed.
