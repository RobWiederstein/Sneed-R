Motion for Retaxation. Most Cited  Cases An erroneous taxation of costs may be corrected on motion, but it is no ground for quashing an execution. Opinion of the Court by Chief Justice BOYLE. THIS is a writ of error to a judgment of the Court below overruling a motion to quash an execution which issued upon a decree dismissing a bill filed by the plaintiff in error against the defendant with costs. The motion to quash was made upon the ground that the clerk had taxed a lawyer's fee for each defendant. That this may be correctly done, in some cases, we have no doubt.--Whether it was properly done in this instance, is however, unnecessary to be decided: for if it was not allowable, it was a clerical misprision, as was held in the case of Hubbard v. Hite, [fall term, 1814.] and is amendable upon a motion for that purpose, but forms no ground for quashing the execution. The motion to quash the execution was correctly overruled. Judgment affirmed with costs. Ky.App. 1815. Walton v. Brashears 4 Bibb 18, 7 Ky. 18, 1815 WL 635 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
