 *1 THIS was a bill in chancery, to recover a surplus which is alleged to be contained in the boundaries of two small tracts of land, sold and conveyed by the complainant to the ancestor of the defendant. On hearing, the bill was dismissed by the Circuit Court, and the complainant has appealed to this Court. We are of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court is correct. There is indeed a seeming contrariety in the tes??imony of the witnesses, but the whole of the testimony is upon a fair and candid construction reconcilable, and leads to a very satisfactory conclusion that the sale was in gross and not by the acre, and that the transaction was fair, and not liable to the imputation of fraud. Decree affirmed, with costs.
