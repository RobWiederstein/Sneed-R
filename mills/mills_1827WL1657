Testimony for or Against Interest. Most Cited  Cases A witness cannot be excused from deposing because he has an interest in the matter in controversy which he may prejudice by his testimony. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. It seems to the court there is error in the judgment of the court below, because that court excused the witness, Cox, from deposing, merely because he alleged himself to be interested against the title of the plaintiff set up in this ejectment, though not interested in this controversy or the land now in dispute, when according to the decisions of this court,  Gorham v. Carrol, 3 Litt. Rep. 222; Black, &c., v. Crouch, Ibid., 226, and Robinson, &c., v. Neall, &c., at the last term, a witness can not be excused or privileged from deposing, on account of having an interest even in the matter of controversy, which he may be in danger of prejudicing by his testimony. It is no excuse for a witness that he is interested in the suit, not being a party, the adversary to his interest may require him to testify. Judgment reversed with costs, and verdict set aside, and cause remanded for new proceedings, not inconsistent herewith. Hardin, for plaintiff. Ky.App. 1827. Conover v.
