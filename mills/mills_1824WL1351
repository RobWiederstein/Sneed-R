CRITTENDEN for plaintiff; BRECKINRIDGE for defendants. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. It was erroneous to try the cause as to Waring, without disposing of it as to Gardner, the other defendant, from whom Waring obtained the note by assignment, the judgment on which is enjoined by the bill. Besides, the merits of the case did not entitle Waring to any decree, because it was not shown that Gardner had any title to the land for which the notes were given, and which he was to convey. Of parties to a suit in chancery. A man demanding the purchase money for land, must show that he is able to convey it. The decree must, therefore, be reversed with costs, and the cause be remanded, that further proceedings may there be had against both defendants below, not inconsistent with this opinion.
