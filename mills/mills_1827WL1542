OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. The only question in this case, arising between the complainant and defendant in chancery, is the appropriation of a credit, for a payment made by the complainant, to the defendants, who held demands on him, due by different securities or undertakings. The complainant had undertaken to pay the defendants the amount of certain claims due to them by a third person. One of those claims was due by a replevin bond, in which the complainant was surety, and the others by a simple undertaking, not yet settled by judgment. The payment in contest was made, and a receipt given therefor, without specifying to which. The complainant contends that it is to go in discharge of the replevin bond first; the defendants, to the other claim. Controversy of the parties concerning the application of a payment. The payor may direct to which demand, a payment shall be applied. If he does not do it, the payee may apply it. If both fail the law will apply it, by adjudging presumptions between the parties, and generally in a court of equity, a payment will be applied to a demand bearing interest, where there is another not bearing interest, between the same parties. Here it is not certainly shown whether the demand contended for by the defendants, does, or does not, bear interest, although it most probably does. But it is evident that the demand which the complainant insists upon to be first extinguished, is best secured, and in such a case it is deemed equitable, to apply the credit to the debt, the security of which is most precarious--according to the case of  Field, &c. v. Holland, 6 Cranch, 8. To this demand the court below, applied this credit, and there is, therefore, no error in the decree, and it must be affirmed with costs and damages. Rule given for the appropriation of payments made generally, and which had not been applied by the parties. Robertson, for plaintiff. Ky.App. 1827. Blanton v.
