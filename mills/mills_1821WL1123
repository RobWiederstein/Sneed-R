Most Cited Cases (Formerly 358k49(1)) A court of equity will not decree the specific execution of a contract, unless it is based on some fair and valuable consideration. JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The plaintiff in error exhibited his bill in the court below, shewing that John May, in his lifetime, having had sundry dealings with Col. Lee, Doctor Skinner, and Gilbert Imlay, and that May being desirous of making a compromise of these dealings, offered to give said Lee 3,000 acres of land, and for that purpose, wrote a letter to his brother George May to the following effect: "I have proposed to make Col. Lee a present of 3,000 acres of land upon the adjustment of our matters: Therefore wish you to pick out lands to that amount. I would wish them to be good, and that you would choose such as lie conveniently. I am not to warrant the lands, but will have a deed made with warranty against Will May, the present grantee, as soon as Col. Lee shall order it. The land is for sale, and therefore the deed need not be made till he sells, unless he chooses it. Pray write to him on the subject. Direct to the care of John Hopkins and desire him to give orders about the deed, also to send my bond for the 2,000 acres of land, which I have his receipt for the discharge of. (Signed)                                  JOHN MAY." He charges that George May sent a copy of the letter to Hopkins endorsed, that the original would be taken care of for Col. Lee's benefit, and that John May died shortly afterwards, and that he (the complainant below) had bought all the interest of Lee, Imlay and Skinner, to lands in Kentucky, and received their deed including the foregoing claim. And that after the death of May, the agent of the estate acknowledged the justice of the claim and promised to satisfy it, but never did, and that the heirs of said John May refused to comply with the engagement. He insists that the compromise or adjustment of the claims or dealings between John May and Lee, was the consideration for the writing, and that he had purchased the claim for a valuable consideration. He makes the heirs and representatives of John May, the agent of the estate, who had acknowledged the justice of the claim, William May, who held the legal estate of these lands, Henry Lee and George May, defendants; and alleges that part of the heirs of John May, George May and Lee were non-residents of this state, and prays an exhibition of titles for lands, and a conveyance to satisfy the claim or a compensation in damages. The heirs of John May appeared and pleaded the act to prevent frauds and perjuries, and also demurred to the bill. No other defendants appeared, and order of publication was had against the absentees. The court below, on argument, sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill; to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted. *2 We perceive no objection to the decree that a consideration, either good or valuable, is necessary in every contract, which equity will enforce, is a principle too well understood to need the support of authority, and no such consideration is shewn by the letter itself in the present case. Indeed the object of the writing was an intended gratuity. The bill alleges that the adjustment of dealings between the parties was the consideration. This admits of two answers. The obligations of the bill presents it, in such a shape that the adjustment might have been an inducement to the present, but not a consideration. And the writing itself declares it an intended present, and negatives the idea that there was any other consideration; and it is not pretended that there was any fraud or mistake in drawing the instrument. The demurrer was therefore properly sustained as to the heirs of John May. A consideration either good or valuable is essential to the validity of a promise and the chancellor will never decree specifically a mere gratuity. But it is contended that the court below ought not to have dismissed the bill as to the other defendants, and that relief might be had against them. As to William May, he holds the legal estate, out of which the present was to be satisfied; and to reach this estate which it is alleged he was bound to convey to the heirs of John May, was the design in making him defendant. As the plaintiff in error has shewn no title to relief against the heirs of John May, he can have no pretext for relief against William, who holds the legal estate for them, and who is only bound to convey it to them or in discharge of valid contracts made by them on their ancestor. The dismission of the bill, therefore, as to him, necessarily followed its dismission, as to the heirs of John May. As to the agent of May's estate, who acknowledged the justice of the demand, it cannot be pretended that these acknowledgments bound him individually, and they could only operate upon the estate of John May, and for dismissing the bill, as to him, no injustice is done to the plaintiff in error. George May was the person to whom the original letter was addressed, and he retained a copy of it for the use of Lee, and seems never to have refused the use of it, and appears to have had no interest in the transaction, and there is no apology for making him defendant. Lee is the remaining defendant, with whom the complainant below dealt, and of whom he bought the writing in question. Whether the complainant is entitled to any relief against him, we have not thought it necessary to decide. For as he is a non-resident the jurisdiction of the court below, as to him, could not be sustained except by joining him properly with other defendants, who were parties or privies to the same transaction. As the other defendants residing here were improperly made, or the plaintiff in error has shewn no claim for relief against them, Lee cannot be compelled to answer and defend the suit, barely because the plaintiff in error has improperly called before the court others with him over whom the court has jurisdiction, but against whom he has no claim, as was decided by this court in the case  Curts v. Hill, &c. 3 Bibb, 465. *3 On rendering this opinion, Mr. Littell presented the following petition: To the honorable the judges of the court of appeals, for the commonwealth of Kentucky, the petition of William Littell, the attorney of Henry Banks, humbly sheweth: That in the decision of the writ of error, in the case of Banks v. May's heirs, there is, in his humble opinion, error in the following particulars: First, in that the court have decided that a suit in chancery could not have been maintained by Lee himself on the contract alluded to in the letter; and secondly, in inferring from that postulation, that no bill could be maintained by the complainant. On the first point your petitioner will premise that he does not assume the position that a bill in chancery would lie to enforce a gift, merely voluntary and gratuitous, nor has he ever understood this bill in that light. The only reason for considering the promise merely gratuitous, which your petitioner has understood the court to assign, or can conceive to exist, is on the supposition that the word "present," ex vi termini, implies a lack of all consideration, valuable or good. The word "present" is not a technical term, consequently, the meaning of it must be ascertained from approved authorities in language. Ainsworth renders it donum, munus. He renders donum, gift, reward; and munus, he renders a gift, reward, retribution. This is sufficient to shew that the word "present" does not necessarily exclude the idea of a valuable consideration for the thing presented. Your petitioner admits that it may exclude it, but he understands the decision of the court as predicated on the opinion that the word "present" does and must necessarily exclude the idea of a valuable consideration in all cases whatever. Taking the case then merely on the import of the word "present," it assumes the following attitude. The letter is the language of the stipulator only. He has used a term which may mean a gratuity, or may mean a reward or retribution for services rendered, or money or property received; consequently, the case comes at once within the letter and spirit of that rule of the civil law.--In stipulationibus cum queritur quid actum sit, verba contra stipulatorem interpretanda sunt, as well as within a rule of the common law of similar import, and too well known to be repeated. But the case does not depend on the real import of the word "present" taken in all the nakedness of metaphorical abstraction. The letter itself manifests that there were extensive dealings, not of the gratuitous character, between the parties, and that some consideration, connected with, or resulting from, contracts relating to land, was the quid pro quo for this "present." It is not believed that the court intend to overrule the recent decision in the case of Bell's heirs v. Breckenridge's heirs, Mar. 563. And if that decision remains unimpeached, the statute against frauds and perjuries cannot be applied to this case. If in that case the court would not presume that the contract was made after the first day of January, 1787, because the date of the contract did not appear, they cannot in this case, where the date is wholly uncertain. All questions then as to the sufficiency of the letter to prove the whole of the contract for the sale of the land, and whether that deficiency may be supplied by testimony aliunde, seem to be silenced. *4 This letter is not offered as the written contract made between Lee and May, nor does it purport to be so, but merely as a particle of evidence that such contract had been previously made. The contract is stated as a substantive fact in the bill, and this as an item of evidence conducing to prove that fact, and certainly the insufficiency of that item of evidence must be unavailing on a demurrer questioning the validity of the contract itself. Prior to the passage of the statute of frauds, no contract in writing was necessary, consequently, a contract stated generally, on a valid consideration, would have been sufficient, and the introduction of the letter into the bill was mere surplusage which could not vitiate the statement respecting the contract itself, of course, the question does not occur whether in contracts for the sale of lands before the statute of frauds, or what amounts to the same thing, in contracts for the sale of personal property, at this time the proof may be partly oral in aid of a written contract. The letter is introduced merely as evidence, that a contract, prior to that time, had been made; as an evidence of the admission of it by May, and that by such admission and promise to comply with it, he induced Banks to purchase the land from Lee. Taking for granted that the contract between May and Lee was on a valuable consideration and every way valid, May could not, merely by calling it a present, at any indefinite period afterwards, render it void and discharge himself from his obligation to Lee to comply with it, and it is utterly inconceivable how Banks can on any moral or rational principle stand in a worse situation than Lee. If May had asserted in his letter that Lee had won the land from him at gaming, or otherwise defrauded him of it, if, in short, his letters had not only denied the existence of any valuable or good consideration, but had averred the existence of every one vile and void, Lee would not have been precluded from filing his bill stating the contract as it was, proving a consideration valid in law, and recovering according to the nature and extent of his proof. If the letter of May was liable to demurrer it ought to have been a demurrer to evidence, not to the bill; here was a demurrer to the bill, and the only cause of demurrer appears to be an exception to part of the evidence brought in support of that bill and on this account the bill itself is dismissed. Admitting that the bill was inartifically drawn, a dismission without prejudice was the proper course. The court are requested to acknowledge the possibility, that prior to the first day of January, 1787, there was a valid contract between May and Lee for the conveyance of such a tract of land, that the contract was for a valuable consideration, that Lee could have enforced it in equity, and that in relation to that contract he wrote this letter, and that Banks was the bona fide assignee of Lee. Yet, by the absolute dismission of this bill, he is denied all relief. *5 But, secondly, it is believed to be immaterial, in this case, whether the consideration, passing from Lee to May, was either good or valuable, or whether there was in fact any consideration. May gave a written promise to convey the land to whomsoever Lee should sell it, Lee did sell it to Banks, and Banks paid the consideration; therefore, as between Banks and May there was a consideration fully paid, and if May, by his voluntary act, knowingly, caused Banks to pay that consideration, it is believed that no principle of law or equity will permit any allegation of want of consideration afterwards. Whether May received it or not is immaterial; he was the occasion of its being paid to Lee, and paying it to Lee was just as expensive to Banks as paying it to May would have been. The letter of May must be considered as stronger evidence of his perfect satisfaction with the contract with Lee, and his undissembled intention to comply with it, than it would have been if directed to Banks himself, because it evidently put it in Lee's power to sell the land to the nearest friend that May had no earth; this Banks must have known, and therefore could not have entertained a suspicion that there was any cause why May should refuse to comply with it--Banks might have been indifferent to him--might have been his enemy, but it is altogether incredible that there were no men on earth for whom he felt regard enough to refrain from doing what must necessarily have put it in the power of Henry Lee, to have defrauded them to such an amount, without the possibility of redress, which would have been the case if he did not intend to perform his promise. Your petitioner does not feel it incumbent on him to ask anything more, in behalf of his client in this case, than the courts of Virginia and of Kentucky have uniformly granted to the innocent assignee of gaming contracts, altho he feels that there is a difference between contracts to which no principle of turpitude can be imputed, which violate no municipal or moral law, and contracts stamped with the reprobation of society, and which render the contracting parties infamous. As early as the year 1793, in the case of Hammond v. M'Cullom, this court laid down these principles--"When the obligor in a bond, encourages the purchase of it by an assignee, and promises to pay it, if there is no fraud practised, by the assignee, in obtaining such assignment, the obligor shall be precluded from setting up against the assignee any equity which he may have against the obligee." This was a decision made on principle, for it was not only prior to the publication of the cases of Buckner v. Smith, 1 Wash. 299, and Hoomes v. Smack, 1 Wash. 389, but before those cases were decided. However, those cases recognize and affirm the same principle, and apply it to gaming bonds, which are absolutely void. The case of Short v. Jackson & Young, in this court, is an additional authority and a case more in point, printed decisions, p. 224. There the court lay it down as a general principle, that an assumpsit to an assignee will operate as a release of equity. In that case, Short had promised his obligee that he would pay the bonds to any merchant who would take them--he wrote to Jackson and Young to the same import--Jackson and Young bought them and assigned one of them to Berry, to whom Short never wrote, never made any promise. The court decided that the promise made to the obligee, and the letter written to Jackson & Young, were available to bar the equity. That is, if Jackson and Young were informed that Short had made an unconditional promise, to his obligee, to pay to any merchant to whom he should assign them, that his equity was barred, as against them, and that his writing to them to that effect barred his equity against Berry, their assignee. *6 The case of Morrison v. Clay has, justly, been considered a leading case, in this country, on this subject. In that case the court explain the principles and shew that, in transactions of this kind, it is immaterial whether the original consideration was valid or void, and that the actual consideration is what the assignee was induced to part with by the fraud or folly of the original obligor. If John May had advertised that he would convey this land to any person who would pay Lee $5,000, or to any person who would produce Lee's receipt for that sum, it is not conceivable on what principle he could object to the person whom he had induced to advance such a sum of money, that he did not owe it to Lee, or if he did that Lee could not have compelled him to pay it. Yet the defense offered in this case is substantially the same and not more meritorious. The circumstance of his declaration not having been published in the newspapers can not change the principle. The letter shews that it never was contemplated that the conveyance should be made to Lee personally, and was, in effect, an address to all persons to whom Lee should offer the land for sale--was intended for his benefit--to be put into his possession--to give him credit with the world to that amount. It was put into his possession, he might have published it if he pleased--it did give him credit to the full extent which he and May wished it to do, for it enabled him to sell the land to Banks; he did sell it, received pay, and delivered over this letter to Banks as evidence of his right. Your petitioner has no reason to believe, nor does he believe, that May, at the time he wrote this letter, did not intend to comply with it, or did not intend to subject himself to an action at the suit of the purchaser for non-compliance. If it shall be said that every man would know that a free gift could not be enforced, and therefore no injury could be done, the answer is, that few men know this even at this time, and it is believed that fewer still knew it then. But May did not intend that this should be considered as a mere gratuity, as is manifest from his using an equivocal word, and from his referring to the extensive dealings between him and Lee, and least of all did he intend that it should appear to those to whom Lee should offer the land for sale that the land could not be recovered from him. If he had merely stated that it was a gift to Lee, as selling gifts is thought disrespectful to the giver, some cautious man might have doubted whether, if Lee should sell it, May would confirm the sale. He removes this difficulty, he says it may be sold; he goes further, and shews that it is certainly to be sold, that it is never to vest in Lee, himself; it is to make no part of the peculium formed by the kindness of his friends, but is to pass immediately to his stock in trade, to form a part of it, and to be sold to the best advantage. If May was sincere, in the whole of this proceeding, he was evidently bound by contract to convey to the purchaser. If he was insincere, if he used the language, which he has, for the purpose of enabling Lee to defraud a purchaser, he ought to be compelled, on account of the fraud, to realize the expectations he had raised. All which is respectfully submitted and a rehearing prayed. *7 WM. LITTEII. But the court, on consideration, overruled the petition and ordered the opinion to stand unaltered.
