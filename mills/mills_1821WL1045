JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is a writ of error to reverse a decision of the court below, quashing an execution in an action of debt. The court has had great difficulty in determining that the bill of exceptions, taken to the opinion of that court, is sufficient to authorize the interposition of this court. Some doubts are entertained whether, from the wording of that document, the whole ground taken in the court below is now presented to this court; and whether some extraneous matter, not set out, might not have been the cause of the quashal. But as the motion appears to have been made without notice, and the defendant in the motion appears to have moved unsuccessfully to amend the supposed defect in the execution, we are rather led to conclude that the want of thirty days, between the teste and return, has been the sole ground which has caused the execution to be set aside. The execution is dated on the 29th July, 1819, and is made returnable to the Saturday next succeeding the fourth Monday in the ensuing August, which was the 28th of that month, according to the computation we have made, and leaves the space of thirty days, counting the day of the teste exclusive, and including the return day. We conceive the expressions of the statute, "thirty days at least between the teste and return," and not between the day of the teste and day of return, does not warrant a departure from the general rule of counting time named in a statute, to-wit, of excluding one day and including the other, as decided in Pollard v. Yoder, spring term, 1820, 2 Marshall, 267, and the cases there cited. In the computation of time, the day of the teste of process is to be counted, and the return day executed, or vice versa. *2 The decision of the court below must therefore be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, with directions to overrule the motion to quash the execution with costs.
