Most Cited Cases Where an action of debt on notes discounted at the Bank of Kentucky is a joint one against drawer and indorser, it is statutory, and must go for the debt and interest and costs of protest, and action for debt only cannot be sustained. OPINION OF THE COURT BY JUDGE MILLS. This is a joint action, against the maker and endorser of a promissory note, negotiated in bank. The writ was sent to a distant county to be served on the endorser. The bank had judgment by default. The following errors appear in the proceedings. Execution of process after the return day, is nought. 1st. The writ on the endorser was executed after the return day. The return day was the 10th of October, 1825, and the day of execution was the 12th of the same month. For this reason no judgment ought to have been given. Actions of debt on notes discounted at Bank of Ky. made bills of exchange, against principal and endorser, must be for the debt, interest and costs of protest, and not maintainable for debt only. 2nd. As the action is a joint one against drawer and endorser, it is statutory, and must go for the debt and interest, and costs of protest; and the party has brought it for the debt only. The action, for this reason can not be sustained, nor can there be further proceedings on the return of the cause. Judgment reversed with costs, and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the suit, with costs. Monroe, for appellants; Crittenden, for appellees. Ky.App. 1828. Noel v.
