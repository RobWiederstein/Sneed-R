HARDIN, BIBB, SHARP and HUSTON for May's heirs; HAGGIN AND CRITTENDEN for Frazee. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. John Tabb was possessed of two Virginia land-office treasury warrants, amounting to the quantity of 42,532 acres, which were entered in his name, in five separate entries, on the 24th of December, 1782, and were afterwards granted by patents from the commonwealth of Virginia, jointly, to said John Tabb and John May, except one which was granted to Tabb alone; so that each became vested with one undivided half of the legal estate. On the 15th of August, 1785, before the emanation of the patents, John May made out a statement of them, with other warrants, showing the interest therein, of Tabb and the other owners, in the following wards: Where an estate is devised to executors, in trust, to sell, convey, etc., they may act by attorney; otherwise, if the will gives nothing but a naked authority. "John Tabb, two warrants, No. 9,793 and 9,794, the said Tabb's proportion being three sixth parts; the said William Kennedy and William May, one sixth part, each; the remaining sixth part is the said John and George May's joint property. All expenses to be paid by said Tabb." *2 A husband who is executor in right of his wife, may sell the chattels of the estate which pass by delivery, or release debts; but it seems that he can not convey lands which the will directed her to convey; and it is certain, that he can not sell lands which were so devised to her in trust, as to vest the legal title in her. He added to the close of this list, a declaration that the foregoing was a statement of the locations made in partnership between the before mentioned parties, and thereto signed his name as the agent of all the persons concerned. On the same day, William May endorsed on the back of this statement, that it was correct, and transferred his interest therein to Matthew Walton, who was to stand in his place; and John May, by another endorsement, agreed to convey to Walton the interest of the said William May. Walton, on the 10th day of September, 1795, made an endorsement on the same paper, assigning the same interest to Lewis Craig. On the 27th of March, 1792, George May, by a proper writing, sold and assigned all his interest in said lands to Philemon Thomas. On the 5th day of June, 1787, John May and William Kennedy made an exchange of part of their interest in two of the tracts; John May gave part of the entry of 18,000 acres, now the subject of this controversy, and Kennedy gave up therefor, part of his interest in another entry of 4,532 acres, (all in the name of Tabb,) and entered into writings as follows: Query, whether there is any law, except the act of 1812, which will authorize a feme covert to convey lands by attorney, whether she holds the land in her own right, to her own use, or in trust for others --Vide 2d opinion. "Whereas William Kennedy and John May are interested in several tracts of land, surveyed in the name of John Tabb, lying on the Ohio, below the mouth of Big-Bone creek, being part of a location for about four thousand five hundred acres; and also, in another survey of 18,000 acres, made in the said Tabb's name, near the Ohio, on the waters of Lee's creek: It is therefore agreed upon, that the said Kennedy shall give up to the said May, all his interest in the land lying on the Ohio, below the Big-Bone creek; in consideration whereof the said May agrees to give up to the said Kennedy, out of the aforesaid survey of 18,000 acres, six acres for every five that the said May shall obtain, in right of the said Kennedy, out of the first mentioned lands; which lands so to be given the said Kennedy by the said May, shall be equal in value to the generality of the said May's share of the said 18,000 acres." The facts stated in a private act of assembly, are evidence, and strong evidence against those who obtained its passage. On the 6th day of September, 1792, said Kennedy sold to said Lewis Craig all his interest in the said 18,000 acre tract, including, not only his original proportion of one sixth, but also the additional share which he was to have therein by virtue of the aforesaid exchange with John May; and writings were executed accordingly. This additional quantity gotten by the exchange with John May, when calculated at the rate of six acres for each five of Kennedy's interest in the Big-Bone entry, amounted to 840 acres. On the 28th of March, 1794, Philemon Thomas obtained from John Tabb a conveyance in fee, of all his interest in the said tracts of land patented to May and Tabb, in which purchase Craig was, to some extent, a partner, but his name is not known in the conveyance, nor is it material in this controversy to what extent. *3 According to the foregoing transfers, Craig and Thomas seem to have been entitled to most of the whole 18,000 acres, to-wit, one-half from John Tabb, one-sixth from William May through Matthew Walton, one-half sixth from George May, one-sixth from William Kennedy, and 840 acres of the remaining half sixth of John May; so that the interest still remaining in John May appears to be only 660 acres, supposing the tract to be divided by equal quantities. John May was killed by the Indians, in 1790, and his will, which will be hereafter more particularly noticed was afterwards recorded in Chesterfield county, Virginia, where he resided; but none of the executors named in the will qualified as such, or took upon them the execution of the will, until the year 1797, in the month of July, when his widow, who had previously married Thomas Lewis, qualified as executrix. On the 28th of June, 1792, the legislature of this state, on the petition, and at the instance of said Philemon Thomas and Lewis Craig, passed an act of assembly to the following effect: "Whereas John Tabb and John May were seized and possessed of the legal titles in and to forty thousand five hundred and sixty-seven acres of land, and the said John Tabb to twelve hundred and seventy-nine acres, situated in the counties of Mason, Bourbon and Woodford, by virtue of entries made with the surveyor of Fayette, in the name of said John Tabb, bearing date the 24th day of December, in the year of our Lord, 1782; and whereas, by various agreements and assignments, the equitable right to said lands, amounting in the whole to forty-one thousand eight hundred and forty-six acres, has become vested in John May, Lewis Craig and Philemon Thomas, in the following proportions; that is to say, to the said John May, ten thousand four hundred sixty-one and a half acres, and to the said Lewis Craig and Philemon Thomas, the residue, which is thirty-one thousand three hundred and eighty-four acres; and whereas the said John May nath departed this life, leaving a last will and testament duly executed, proved and recorded in the county court of Chesterfield, by which he directed that the executors therein named should take all necessary steps to complete all his land claims, and the said executors having neglected or refused to take upon themselves the execution of the said will, the right of the said John May, in and to the above mentioned proportions of the said land, has descended to Mary May and John May, his only children and heirs at law, who, being infants under the age of twenty-one years, can not enter into an agreement with the said Lewis Craig and Philemon Thomas, concerning a division of the said land, agreeably to their respective interests therein; and whereas the said Lewis Craig and Philemon Thomas, being desirous of settling their proportion of the said land, have petitioned the general assembly that an act may pass directing the manner in which such a division shall be made of said land: *4 Be it enacted by the general assembly, That Alexander D. Orr, Arthur Fox and Miles W. Conway, gentlemen, or any two of them, may lay off and divide the said lands between the heirs of the said John May and the said Lewis Craig and Philemon. Thomas, according to their several interests in the same, as above stated, agreeably to quantity and quality; and that after having so laid off the same, they shall return a fair plat of the said division to the county court of Mason, there to be recorded; which division, so made and recorded, shall be effectual to pass to the said Mary May and John May, and to the said Lewis Craig and Philemon Thomas, the legal title in and to the part so allotted to them respectively, in as full and ample a manner as if the same had been made by order of a court of chancery: Provided, that the said John May and Mary May, may, at any time within two years after they may respectively attain the age of twenty-one years, file a petition in the county court of Mason, stating any objections they may have to the said division of the said land, whereupon the said court shall enquire into the merits of said division, and if it shall be found to have been made in conformity to the directions of this act, they shall confirm the same; but if it shall appear to them to have been made contrary thereto, they shall set aside the same, and make such order therein as shall be agreeable to justice and equity: Provided also, that nothing in this act contained shall be construed to extend to affect the right, title or claim in and to the said lands, or any part thereof, of any person whatever, except the said Mary May and John May, and of the said Lewis Craig and Philemon Thomas." On the 26th of September, 1794, a division of the said 18,000 acre tract, and no other, was returned to the Mason county court, and there recorded, signed by two of the said commissioners named in said act, the third having acted as surveyor in the execution of the survey, but, from some unknown cause, did not join in the report. In this division, the commissioners first platted out some prior interfering claims, and did not include them in the calculation as land belonging to the parties, and divided the residue, assigning to John May's heirs, as their proportion, three thousand five hundred acres; that is, three thousand in one body, and five hundred acres in another, and left ten thousand around a lick then supposed to be valuable, undivided. The quantity of three thousand acres, so assigned to May's heirs, is now the subject of controversy. After Mrs. Lewis, the executrix, had obtained letters testamentary, in Virginia, she and her then husband, Thomas Lewis, on the 27th of May, 1798, executed a letter of attorney to Richard Stevens, William Vawter and John Lewis, of Kentucky, authorizing them fully to do all things necessary to be done under the will of the said John May, in Kentucky, either jointly or severally, "except the executing of titles to lands," which should be done by the whole of them, or the said Stevens; excepting also, "if it should be thought expedient to relinquish any lands," it was to be done as in the case of the execution of titles. The same letter of attorney recited, that Thomas Lewis had a letter of attorney from Joseph Jones, to do certain acts for Joseph Jones, touching lands in this country; and this letter of attorney transferred to Vawter and Stevens, all the powers so delegated to Lewis himself, and authorized them to execute them for Lewis alone. This letter of attorney from Lewis and wife, was acknowledged on the day of its date, before two justices of the peace of Chesterfield county, Virginia, whose offices were certified by the clerk of the county, under the seal of the court, and within three months, was produced to the clerk of this court and recorded by him. On the 29th day of January, 1803, Vawter sold to Lewis Craig all the land assigned by said commissioners, under the act of assembly, to John May's heirs, and executed a conveyance to Craig therefor, in the name of Thomas Lewis alone, and not expressing his executorial character. It purports to convey that part of John Tabb's 18,000 acre tract on Lee's creek, which had been "allotted by Miles W. Conway and Alexander D. Orr, in pursuance to an act of the general assembly, to John May, George May, William May and William Kennedy, and agreeably to the several assignments and contracts to and with said Craig." It also professed to include the interferences with the prior claims which the commissioners had platted out in said division, and purports to convey about eight thousand acres thereof. The deed is signed "Thomas Lewis, by William Vawter, his attorney in fact," and has no allusion to the title of powers of Lewis, under the will of John May, except that in the latter clause is a warranty "against the claim or claims of all those claiming through, by or under the title of the said Thomas Lewis, as executor of the estate of John May, deceased." *5 John L. May and Daniel Eppes and wife, the only children of John May, deceased, brought an action of ejectment against the tenants residing on the three thousand acres assigned in a body to the heirs of John May, and recovered a judgment at law. To enjoin this judgment, Lewis Craig, Philemon Thomas, and the several tenants, joined in this bill, setting up the foregoing facts and transfers, admitting that the legal title did not pass to Craig under the deed by Vawter as agent, because it was informally and mistakenly written in the name of Lewis, when it ought to have been in the name of Lewis and wife, as executor and executrix of May, which they say arose from the want of sufficient skill in the parties, and insisting that it was in substance a purchase from the executors, and so intended, and that it ought to be enforced as such, as Vawter had a power to sell, although Stevens was bound to join in the making of titles; that Craig had sold to the tenants, who claimed under him; and if said contract with Vawter could not be enforced, that still, as the interest of all the partners was vested in said Craig and Thomas, by the aforesaid assignment, except about 660 acres left in John May, that a new division ought to be decreed, leaving to the lessors of the plaintiff at law only that quantity, instead of the quantity claimed. The answer denies knowledge of the different sales and assignments of the different parties, set up in the bill; relies on the act of assembly and division under it, as fixing their interest; denies any knowledge of the purchase of Craig from Vawter, and insists that the letter of attorney authorized no such sale; that the consideration given to Vawter had never come to them, and had failed, and that there wes no principle of equity on which said transactions between Craig and Vawter could be enforced against them. The circuit court decided that the sale of Vawter to Craig, passed no equity that could be enforced against the heirs of J. May, and that, of course, Craig, or those claiming under him, had no title to their interest, and then proceeded, disregarding the act of assembly, to settle the interest of Craig and Thomas, by virtue of their several purchases anterior to the purchase of Craig from Vawter, and fixed the interest of J. May's heirs to one-twelfth of the whole, and directed that it should be laid off to them out of the unimproved land, if practicable, somewhere in the whole tract; and that to obtain this, all the tenants on the whole 18,000 acres, who had purchased under Thomas and Craig, should be made parties. The complainants below forthwith amended their bill for this purpose; but afterwards, that amendment was withdrawn by consent, and each party appealed from the interlocutory decree. The first question of importance presented by the appeal of the complainants below, is the validity, in a court of equity, of the contract made between Craig and Vawter, for the interest of the heirs of John May. After the most mature deliberation on this point, we think with the circuit court, that this contract ought not to be specifically enforced against the heirs of John May, and that for the following reasons. *6 The consideration given by Craig was as follows: He executed his notes for five hundred pounds, payable to Thomas Lewis, as the executor of John May. Most of this sum was paid to Vawter in discharge of these notes. Lewis, as executor, refused to receive these notes, and disavowed the act of Vawter in selling, and no part thereof ever went to the benefit of John May's estate. Another part of the consideration was, John May had given a bond to Matthew Patton, binding himself that his interest, when the bond was to be performed, in the 18,000 acre tract, should be at least 3,000 acres, and that he would convey to Patton 1,000 acres, choice of said 3,000 acres. This bond was set up against the estate of J. May, in this country; and Craig conveyed two tracts of land to the heirs or representatices of Patton, in discharge of this bond, which they agreed to accept in satisfaction thereof, it being believed by Vawter, as he deposes, that J. May did not possess a sufficient interest in the 18,000 acres, to discharge the bond to Patton. In these conveyances to the heirs of Patton, Vawter joined with Craig as surety for the title. The bond of Patton was assigned to Vawter individually. Vawter deposes, that he held the bond for the benefit of the estate of John May, intending that it should be extinguished. But on Lewis, the executor in right of his wife, disavowing the sale, Vawter assigned this bond to Robert Johnson, who commenced some legal proceedings thereon against the heirs of May, and the controversy was referred, by order of court, on consent of the parties to referees, who awarded damages against the heirs of J. May, for a breach thereof, for which judgment was rendered, which they have satisfied, or are bound to satisfy. It is evident, then, that if this contract of Vawter was enforced in favor of Craig, it would be attended with particular hardship on the heirs of John May; for they have not received one cent of the consideration, nor has it inured to the benefit of their ancestor's estate; and besides, they are bound to discharge a claim by the act of Vawter, which was to have been discharged by his sale of their land to Craig. And it is a rule in equity, that equity will not enforce a contract specifically, which, by subsequent events, will impose great hardship or loss on the defendant; but will leave the party to his remedy at law. To this, however, it is answered, and that plausibly, that Vawter was the agent of the estate and not of Craig, and that if Vawter misapplied the consideration of the purchase, it was not the business of Craig, but of the executors, who, or their agent, are responsible. To this, however, we reply, that admitting, for the sake of argument, without giving any positive opinion thereon, that Craig was not bound to see to the appropriation of the property paid by him, it is certain that Patton's bond could have been discharged out of the 18,000 acre tract. The commissioners had long before, under an act of assembly, procured on the joint petition of Craig and Thomas, when they themselves had the fixing of May's interest, laid off 3,500 acres to May's estate. These facts were certainly known to Craig, and, perhaps, to Vawter. If they were known to the former alone, he did not represent the true state of the case to either Vawter or Patton, which he ought to have done, so that the bond might have been discharged by the land it called for, instead of other lands from Craig, in order that he might obtain the whole 18,000 acres. If these facts were known to both Vawter and Craig, it makes Craig's case no better; for it was improper for them to combine to purchase up the bond, with other lands, under a pretext that it could not be discharged with the lands it claimed on its face, contrary to the truth of the fact. Another circumstance conduces to show unfairness. The deed from Vawter to Craig, purports to convey the lands laid off by the commissioners "to John May, George May, William May and William Kennedy," when there was no such land laid off, nor had the commissioners any power to lay off any lands to George or Wiliam May, or William Kennedy; but only for the heirs of John May and Thomas and Craig. Now this statement must have been procured by Craig, who knew better, to the deception of Vawter, or both knowing otherwise, so stated it to blind the executor and heirs. Add to this, that Vawter deposes that Craig knew the extent of his power of attorney, and that he was not authorized to convey, and was possessed of every circumstance relative to the defects thereof, and took the conveyance at a risque. These circumstances precluded Craig from standing in the attitude of innocence and ignorance, and make him, measurably, particeps criminis in the mal-appropriation of the money, or at least show that he entered into a contract defective, and not advantageous to the heirs, with his eyes open, and not containing on its face, the truth of the case. They are circumstances which render his case unfavorable, and if they are so for him, they must be equally so for the other complainants in the bill, as they have not shown how they hold under him, whether as innocent purchasers or as tenants, or that they have any length of time in their favor. *7 Other objections lie against enforcing this contract. It has been decided by this court in the case of May's heirs v. Slaughter, 3 Marsh. 504, that Mrs. Lewis took the legal estate under the will, when she administered and that previous thereto, the heirs held it subject to the contingency of her administration. It has been contended in argument, that she only had a power to sell, and that such power could not be delegated to an attorney, according to the maxim delegatus non potest delegari. This, as a general principle, is admitted, and is well established in Buger v. Duff, 4 John.Chan. Rep. 368, and authorities there cited. Here, however, the will of John May devised as follows: "I give and bequeath my land to my executors hereinafter named, and to the survivers or surviver of such of them as may act, and their heirs, for the purpose of selling as much thereof as will pay all my debts of every kind." He also proceeds to give them ample powers, not only to sell and convey, but to adjust and compromise and convey in discharge of some specific legacies, and then directs the residue of his estate to go to his widow and the two defendants in the court below, who were his children, in equal proportions. These provisions of the will, give more than a power, and vest an interest or the legal estate, so that the objection that a power can not be delegated to an agent, does not apply. Still, however, an objection equally formidable, remains. The title went to Mrs. Lewis on her administration, and although she might not be able to execute the trust and part with the estate, without her husband's joining in the act, as he was to be responsible for mal-administration; yet, we conceive that he could not sell and convey, without she was joined in the deed. It is true, a husband who is executor in right of his wife, may sell the chattels of the estate which pass by delivery, and release debts without the consent of his wife; but it is not so clear, that he could sell real estate, under a bare power given in a will. But without expressing any opinion on this point, we have no hesitation in saying, that he could not sell lands, the title of which was in her. In this case, the title was vested in trust for particular purposes; but we are aware of no rule of law which would make it an exception from the general rule, that the husband can not sell and pass the lands of the wife, unless she is joined. In this case, she had signed and sealed the power to Vawter, as well as her husband; but we are aware of no law in existence at the date of this power, which enabled a feme covert to sell and convey lands by letter of attorney, even if the estate was her own and not held in trust; and we see no reason why this case of a trust should be an exception, unless there was a collateral power. It results then, that the letter of attorney conferred no power on the agents to sell lands without her, and that she is of course no party to this contract between Vawter and Craig, and as she is not, Craig could not acquire a legal or equitable estate. And this will be the result, even if it be admitted that Vawter executed the power inartificially, by mistaking the proper mode, of which there is no proof. And indeed this is a circumstance which rather casts a shade of suspicion on the transaction. It is somewhat probable that the title was so executed designedly, and that both entered into it, for the purpose of giving Craig the semblance of a legal title to enable him to have the color of right to convey to the purchasers from him, who were pressing him for conveyance. *8 Vide, post, 2d opfnion. As the contract then between Craig and Vawter, can not be enforced specifically, the parties go back to their original interest, which they held before that sale took place; and the inquiry remains, what that interest is, which then belonged to the representatives of John May? Was it the fraction of a twelfth, as seems to appear from the writings produced by the complainants below, or is it the fourth, as fixed by the act of assembly? This question must turn upon the weight which this act of assembly is to have in the cause, coupled with other circumstances; for it is clear that by the writings held by Craig and Thomas, the interest of the representatives of May, is far less than the statute assigns them. We need not here enquire into and determine whether the division directed by this act, was such a power as could be exercised directly by the legislature, and whether it vested the legal estate in the parties, according to its directions. If it was the act of the legislature of a country which could exercise all powers, legislative, judicial and executive, there could be no doubt that such an act might conclude the rights of the parties; but in this country, where the powers of government are divided, and confided by the constitution, each to a separate body of magistracy, and none of these bodies can exercise the powers properly belonging to another, the question whether the legislature could make such division, depends upon the inquiry, whether the power of making partitions in such a case as this, is exclusively judicial? But without going into the inquiry now, how far the legislative act is a record that ought to estop the parties, and inclining to the opinion that it could not estop the heirs of May, who were not consulted on its passage, and consequently that it ought not to conclude the other parties, as such estoppels must be mutual, we have no hestitation in viewing the act as strong evidence of a satisfactory nature, that the facts recited therein are true, even if it be conceded that the subject-matter was not proper for legislation. Let it be recollected that the different proportions of the partners, as shewn by the writings, are as they existed some four or five years before the death of May, and on the aforenamed bond, which he gave to Matthew Patton, he expressed an intention and covenanted to have a greater interest when the bond fell due, which gave him a motive to acquire more than the one-twelfth. At the passage of the act, Craig and Thomas could not have any motive to represent their interest less than it really was. They told their own story, without any to confront them. They do not appear to be in any manner ignorant of their own rights or those of the heirs of May. It is also evident from the recitals of the act, as well as one of the patents which issued wholly to Tabb, whose interest was not conveyed to Thomas for nearly two years afterwards, that the interest of Tabb himself, had been altered from the manner in which it stood in 1785, when May gave the writing determining the respective interest of the parties. The act, it is true, recites a quantity different from that of the warrants; but still the act is correct, as the quantity there recited agrees precisely with the quantity which was surveyed and patented. Under such circumstances, the admissions of Thomas and Craig before the legislature, ought to be taken against them, even if the legislature had no power to pass the act. Such an admission in a court of record, which had no jurisdiction of the case, ought to weigh strongly against them. It is true, it is decided by this court, in the case of  Elmondorff, &c. v. Carmichael, &c., 3 Litt. Rep. 472, that the recital in a private act of assembly, can not be evidence against strangers, or conclude their rights. Still, if admissions were there made against the parties procuring the passage of the act, such admissions ought to be heard against them, on the principle that their writings and saying may be used as evidence against, and not for them. The recitals in such an act, as said in the case cited, are evidence that facts were so represented to the legislature by the petitioners. It is evidence that Craig and Thomas procured its passage, and that they placed the facts as stated on the legislative records. It ought then to be presumed, that J. May had acquired a greater interest, such as the act acknowledges. The allegation in the bill, that John and George May's part was laid off by the commissioners together, can not be sustained. The quantity laid off for excess, the one-twelfth which they held according to J. May's original statement, the commissioners had no authority to divide in favor of George May, and their acts contradict the assertion. Besides, if we should conjecture how John May in the mean time had increased his interest, we should rather suppose it came from Tabb, than any other partner. It also appears, that the parties conveyed to, and acknowledged the lines of the part assigned by the commissioners to John May's heirs, calling it theirs, and for twenty years did not appear to question it; and the idea of lessening it, must have been an after-thought, when pressed by the ejectment of the heirs of May. We, therefore, conceive that the interest of the heirs of John May, ought not to be made less than the act of assembly, and the division under it procured by Thomas and Craig, make it, and that there is no necessity of propriety in disturbing, at the instance of Craig and Thomas, the purchasers from them in other parts of this large tract, when John May's heirs do not desire it, and are satisfied with what is assigned, and the court below erred in directing this to be done. *9 The decree must, therefore, be reversed, and the cause be remanded, with directions to the court below there to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill with costs. The parties who were defendants in the court below, to-wit, the heirs of John May, Chambers, Paxton and Key, must recover in this court the costs of both appeals. Shortly after this opinion was given, Crittenden and Haggin prayed a rehearing by the petition following: The court is respectfully asked to re-consider this cause, and the decision rendered therein. The great value of the land in controversy; the vital importance of the case to the many settlers, whose ruin is involved in the decision; the perplexed and complicated state of facts embraced in the contest; and the sincere and earnest and deliberate conviction of counsel, that a maturer consideration of the case, will produce a different decision from that which has been rendered; will form, it is hoped, a sufficient apology for troubling the court with this petition. John Tabb, William Kennedy, William May, John and Geo. May, were interested in various land warrants and locations, to the amount of about 42,000 acres. Of these lands, 18,000 acres were surveyed in one tract, and patented to John Tabb and John May; and the interests of the respective partners were as follows?? John Tabb was entitled to   9,000                        acres. 3-6 or 1/2 equal to William Kennedy to 1-6,     3,000 equal to William May to 1-6, equal   3,000 to John and George May to 1-6, 3,000 equal to 18,000 That such were the respective interests of the parties, is incontestable. The answer of the defendants, May's heirs, admits it. John May, then, was entitled only to one-half of one-sixth of said survey, equal to 1,500 acres; this was the total of his interest. It clearly and manifestly appears, moreover, that Craig and Thomas purchased the whole interests of all the partners of John May in said survey, and thereby acquired a right to all the survey except that part which belonged to John May. These purchases by Craig and Thomas, are most satisfactorily established. They are not, so far as we recollect, contested by May's heirs, or questioned in the opinion delivered by the court. And if these facts be true, how can it happen that John May or his heirs, are entitled to more than one-twelfth or 1,500 acres of said survey, or that Craig and Thomas, or those claiming under them, are entitled to less than the whole residue of the tract? If the case stopped here, there could be no difficulty in it. But in June, 1792, an act of assembly was passed, reciting that May's heirs were entitled to one-fourth part of the lands appropriated in partnership as aforesaid, and authorizing a division thereof accordingly, by commissioners named in the act; and under this act, two of the commissioners allotted to May's heirs, 3,500 acres of the 18,000 acre survey. There is no proof or presumption that they made division of any other tract. Under color of this allotment, May's heirs set up a claim to the 3,500 acres; and their right to it has been sanctioned by the decision rendered by this court, and that decision is predicated upon the evidence of title furnished by the before mentioned act of assembly and its preamble. *10 Is this a sufficient foundation for such a decree? The legislature can not by any act of legislation, divest an individual of his right to land, and give it to another. But if they do attempt it, and in an apologetic preamble, state a case that would warrant a court of justice in decreeing to the same effect, is it true that the enacting part would be void, but that the preamble is to survive, as a memorial of truth, to be adopted and acted upon in courts of justice as evidence, and upon its solitary testimony, that land shall be adjudged away from one man and given to another? Such high and prevailing influence, can not, and ought not, to be given to such a species of evidence. If such a doctrine were to prevail, a man might be preambled out of his estate, though he could not be legislated out of it. The preamble of an act is mere surplusage, and is used now generally to justify or excuse the act with which it is connected, and framed generally more with that view, than with any very strict regard to accuracy. It is true, that this court, in the case of  Elmondorff v. Carmichael, 3 Litt. 480, say that the preamble of a private statute, "may be evidence between the commonwealth and the applicant or party for whose benefit the act passed." This must certainly be predicated upon the ground that such preamble has been upon and according to the representations of such applicant or party. Was such the fact in this case? Who applied for the act? The heirs of May say that Craig and Thomas did; but there is no proof of it. Much less is there any proof that they or either of them, concurred in the representations that May's heirs were entitled to one-fourth of said lands. But passing by all this, and conceding that the preamble of such an act may be admitted as prima facie evidence of facts, let us ask if it is competent evidence to prove a purchaser or contract for the purchase of land? Can it supply the place of that written evidence signed by the party to be charged, which the statute of frauds and perjuries requires? It seems most manifestly to us, that it can not. It can certainly be entitled to no more weight than any other proof of the parol declarations of a party. And it is presumed that the most satisfactory testimony, proving that Craig or Thomas, or both, had been heard to say, in the year 1792, that May's heirs were entitled to one-fourth of said survey, would not be considered by this court, as entitling them to retain that proportion. But admit it to be competent evidence; it is only prima facie evidence, and the presumption which it creates of May's having enlarged his interest by purchase, is liable to be repelled. The fact to be ascertained is, what was the extent of May's interest? It was 1,500 acres; no more; so say the written evidences of title. The act of assembly creates a presumption that he had enlarged that interest. That enlargement could only have been made by contract and purchase. Now, let us ask, of whom he made this presumed purchase? We can not suppose that he made it of Tabb, of Kennedy, of William or of George May, without imputing to them the fraud of having sold the same land twice; for it is proved beyond question or controversy, that each of these parties sold their whole original interest to Craig and Thomas, or to others, from they derived it. We can not suppose that such a purchase was made of Craig and Thomas, for the reason above assigned, and for these further reasons, that their interests were acquired after the death of John May, which is proved to have happened in the year 1790, when he was coming to this country from Virginia, where he had in fact been for several years; and the sworn answers of Craig, negative any idea of such purchase. This presumption, then, of purchases by John May, can not be indulged without imputing fraud to some one; without presuming fraud in some one. The presumption of such a purchase, is almost negatived by the answer of May's heirs. They do not pretend to allege any such purchase; to have ever heard of, or to believe in the existence of any such purchase; but, in general terms, say, that they claim it under their ancestor, and the said act of assembly. If they were really entitled, as the preamble of said act recites, to one-fourth of the 18,000 acre survey, why have they not sued for that? Is it because they prefer 3,500 acres of the land, to 4,500, which would be one-fourth of the survey? And is their course to be attributed to mere moderation or forbearance? We think not. They cling to this act of assembly, and are contented with the portion it assigns them, for very different reasons. From their ancestor they inherited but 1,500 acres; from this act of assembly, 3,500; and well may they be content with it, rather than to set up their original or proper right. *11 It has been remarked, that John May's bond to Patton, by which he binds himself that his interest in said survey shall be enlarged to 3,000, strengthens the presumption of his having made subsequent purchases. If such a presumption be at all warranted, it is certainly too feeble to be handled or weighed. The only inference to be drawn from this contract, is, that he intended to purchase; for surely a man can not, by his own contracts, create presumptions in this way, and use them afterwards as evidence to increase his own, and prejudice the rights of others. But on this branch of the cause, there is a very important exhibit, which seems to have been overlooked by the court. We mean the record of the suit instituted by Johnson, as the assignee of May's bond to Patton, against the heirs of the said May. In his bill, Johnson insists on a specific performance; or if May's interest had not been enlarged so as to give him the advantage of the selection to which he was by that contract entitled, then that he should be compensated in damages. In that controversy, the heirs of May did not pretend that their ancestor had enlarged his interest, or that he was entitled to more than his original interest. The cause was submitted to the arbitration of Judge Trimble and the late General Hardin; and although all the parties and the arbitrators, must have been well aware of this act of assembly, yet it was not relied on by May's heirs, as proving any augmentation of their interest; nor was it considered by the distinguished lawyers who arbitrated the case, as any evidence of the enlargement of May's interest. They determined that his interest had not been enlarged, and awarded damages against his heirs. This proves one or both of these things, that May's heirs did not consider their interest as enlarged by that act of assembly, and pretend to claim more than 1,500 acres, or if they did make any such pretension, that it was decided against them, by the most respectable and distinguished lawyers. The questions, then, which arise on this part of the subject, are: 1st. Whether the evidence furnished by this act of assembly and its preamble, is competent to prove an alienation of a right in land, or the acquisition thereof, and to supply the place of the written evidence required by the statute of frauds and perjuries? 2d. If it be competent, is the presumption arising from the act and its preamble, alone and unaided, sufficient to sustain the claim of May's heirs? 3d. Is the presumption which it raises, counteracted and repelled, as it is in this case, by the written evidences of Craig and Thomas' rights; by the circumstance, that it amounts, necessarily, to a presumption of fraud of some one; by the pregnant silence of May's heirs in this cause, forbearing to state any single fact in support of such a presumption, or even to assert the presumption itself; by the proceedings and decision in the controversy with Johnson? Is the presumption so repelled, sufficient to prevail against the clear equity of the complainants, who have been long in the quiet possession of the land in contest, and have greatly improved it? We believe not. *12 It may be remarked here, that in the opinion of the court, it is stated that it does not appear but that all the complainants, the present holders of the land, are the mere tenants of Craig and Thomas. In this point of fact, the opinion is certainly incorrect. They are stated in the pleadings to be purchasers, and many pages of the record are made up of their deeds. That there is some mistake in the preamble and act aforesaid, is very certain. How did it occur? If it must be supposed that Craig and Thomas made to the legislature the representations of fact that are contained in that act, it ought only to be considered as their mistake, and not as evidence of the right of John May. Craig and Thomas had not, at the passage of that act, acquired the interest of all John May's partners. Much of this interest was acquired afterwards, as will appear by reference to the contracts exhibited. They did not know the situation of those outstanding interests, and could not tell in whom they were vested. They might have supposed them all vested in John May; and by this, or some other erroneous calculation, have been led into the error of supposing him entitled to one-fourth. A mistake of this sort would be too severely visited, by the consequences attached to it by the opinion of the court. Touching the effect of the contract between Vawter, as agent for Lewis and wife, and Craig, we have always admitted that the deed is too inartificially prepared, to pass the legal title; but must yet hope, that the transaction evidenced by this instrument, confers a clear equity. The general rule of law does, it is true, disable the wife to convey lands. Indeed, as to the estate of herself or husband, she is without will or power, utterly impotent. But still a married woman may perform the duties of an agent for her husband or others. That she may act as trustee, and can in that character convey, even without her husband, see Fonblanque's Equity,??vol. 1, p. 91; Hargrave's Co. Litt. p. 112, note a. Nor can it possibly be an objection to the exercise of this authority, that she has an interest in the subject. See the same authorities. By the will, Mrs. May was authorized to sell, to compromise, &c., and her liability to do this was not impaired by the interest which was vested in her. Is it possible that John May expected his wife to explore the wilderness, superintend the surveys, investigate the titles, compromise and sell, without the power to call any one to her assistance? At least, she might contract by proxy. By our law, no man can contract for the sale of his lands, but by writing; yet he may orally authorize one to make such a contract. Indeed, we understand that the United States' court has recognized the deed of conveyance by the agents under the present letter of attorney. Vawter, then, had power to stipulate for the sale of this land; he did so stipulate, for a valuable consideration; and it is immaterial to all the purposes of justice, whether he has correctly set forth his character and capacities, whether he called himself agent, in the writings, or declared that he represented the executors; all was combined in Vawter; every thing depended on his will; he gave his assent, and in conscience that assent must prevail. *13 At the date of Vawter's deed, he held by assignment, the bond of May to Patton. Ought not that deed, however unavailing for other purposes, to bind at least that interest? The parties considered that bond, in effect, as extinguished by the assignment to Vawter, and his said deed. It was not for any fraud, or by any collusion, that the bond was permitted to remain in his hands, by Craig and Thomas, after they had in effect acquired a right to it by said deed, which, although it can not operate as a conveyance of the legal title, may and ought, in equity, to be considered as binding and transferring all the right which Vawter had or could dispose of. His subsequent assignment of that bond to Johnson, was fraudulent, and can not affect the previous right of Craig, &c. Johnson's subsequent recovery of damages from May's heirs, may be a hardship upon them, if they were also to lost the land; but that hardship can not change the equity of Craig, &c. The argument derived from this hardship, is completely obviated by the offer made by the complainants in their amended bill, to repay to May's heirs the sum awarded against them in favor of Johnson, if the court should think it equitable to impose such terms. For the reasons which have been thus hastily and imperfectly suggested, and on account of the difficulty, novelty and hardship of the case, a mature re-examination of it is earnestly invited, and a re-hearing of the cause respectfully solicited. CRITTENDEN AND HAGGIN. A reconsideration was had, and on the 24th of April, 1824, the petition was overruled, but the following opinion delivered: On re-considering this cause, we discover no good reasons for a change of the decree already rendered. It is assumed, in the former opinion, that Mrs. Lewis, who held the estate in trust, could not, while a feme covert, convey that estate by letter of attorney, and that she must convey as a married woman. We deem it not necessary to have made that assumption; for the other reasons assigned, we conceive, are fully adequate to prevent the contract between Craig and Vawter, from being specifically enforced. Besides, Vawter, in his sale to Craig, did not execute that power, even if he possessed it, in severalty from his co-agents; but he signed the deed as attorney for Thomas Lewis, only. If the feme covert could execute the trust alone, or create an agency to do it, as is contended, it is evident the contract ought to have been made by Vawter as her agent, in which character he did not act. As it is not, therefore necessary to decide in this cause, whether Mrs. Lewis was or was not subject to the disabilities of a married woman, so as to disable her from executing the trust alone, without her husband, or from doing it by agent, we withdraw the effect of that assumption from the former opinion, as a precedent, and leave the matter unprejudiced, for future consideration and investigation, when a case shall occur rendering its decision necessary. *14 We shall barely correct a mistake of facts, as contained in the record, and as represented in the petition. It is said that the record contains the deeds of the other complainants, besides Thomas and Craig. Upon a strict examination it will be seen that there is not one deed, or other writing, showing any title in the complainants, except Thomas and Craig, and that the deeds filed are deeds from Thomas and Craig to other persons, to show that Thomas and Craig acquiesced in and acknowledged the division lines of May's heirs, as assigned them by the commissioners. The petition for a re-hearing is overruled. Ky.App. 1823. May's Heirs v. Frazee 4 Litt. 391, 14 Ky. 391, 1823 WL 1303 (Ky.), 14 Am.Dec. 159 END OF DOCUMENT
