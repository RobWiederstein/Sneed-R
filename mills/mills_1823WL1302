LITTELL for M'Couns; BRECKINRIDGE for Holmes, &c. This case was decided at the Fall Term 1823, and was suspended on a petition for re-hearing. On the 9th of June, 1824, the following opinion was pronounced. The Reporter relies on the manifest inutility of publishing the former opinion and petition for re hearing, as a justification for not doing it. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. This is a motion to quash an execution and sale made thereby, which was overruled in the court below. In the first opinion rendered by this court, the event of the contest was made to turn exclusively on the uncertainty of the judgment on which the execution issued; but, on more mature reflection, we have suspended and recalled that opinion, and conceive that the construction then given to the judgment, was rather too severe. It is to this effect: A judgment against one of two partners, on a joint note, entered by confession in the singular number held to be a judgment against both, the previous part of the order and other circumstances manifesting that the entry in the singular was a clerical mistake. "Robert Holmes, plaintiff,  ) against         )                            IN DEBT. James M'Coun and David      ) M'Coun, trading under the firm of J. & D.  ) M'Coun, def'ts, This day came the parties aforesaid, and the defendant, in his proper person, acknowledges the plaintiff's action for the sum of fourteen hundred and eighty-four dollars, twenty-nine cents, with interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum, from the first day of July, 1815, until paid, besides costs. It is, therefore considered by the court, with the assent of the plaintiff, that the plaintiff recover against the said defendant, the debt and interest aforesaid, in manner and form as above acknowledged, and also his costs by him herein expended; and the defendant in mercy," &c. *2 Where one of two partners removes himself, and resides out of the jurisdiction of the court, executions may go to other counties, the same as if both had removed. The note is filed, as the act of assembly requires in confessions of judgment in a summary way, and is signed "J. & D. M'Coun." That judgments, as well as other solemn acts of other departments of government, may be void for uncertainty, we have no doubt; but this conclusion ought not to be allowed, when, by any fair and reasonable construction, the sense and extent of the act can be ascertained. The uncertainty in this instance, lies in the use of the verbs, nouns and pronouns in the confession of judgment in the singular number, thereby confining the judgment to one of the defendants, and the consequent doubt as to which of them. It is evident, however, that one at least was convict. This limitation of it to one, is strongly opposed by the fact, that the entry is against both, with a description of their partnership, and that both came into court with the plaintiff, who presented a note signed by both; and then the error appears to commence in the entry, when it is evident that the entry was intended to operate on the interest of both. These last circumstances, we now conceive, ought to preponderate, and must be permitted to change the singular language used in the residue of the entry, ut res magis valeat quam pereat. By this construction, the judgment must be read in the plural number, and must be considered as warranting the execution against both, and so the parties and officers of the court below have uniformly treated it. The next ground relied on, to set aside and quash the execution and sale, is, that after sundry executions to Fayette, where the judgment was obtained, the execution in question was sent to Franklin, to which latter county it is contended the execution ought not to be permitted to go. It was shown, however, that one of the defenders had removed from the county of Fayette to the city of Philadelphia, and the other continued to reside in Fayette. The question then is, did the removal of one defendant authorize the sending of the execution to another county? Give to the act of assembly, 1 Dig. L. K. 484, a reasonable construction, and it will warrant the direction of the execution to Franklin. That act authorizes such direction, where the person against whom judgment shall be obtained, removes himself, or removes his effects, or shall reside out of the limits of the jurisdiction of the court. Here, one of the defendants has removed himself; and also resides without the jurisdiction of the court; and the only plausible contest that can be raised, is, that both defendants must remove, or reside abroad, before the execution can go. This construction we consider too narrow, and calculated to keep alive the evil which the legislature intended to remedy. Here, the person against whom judgment has been obtained, has removed himself, and, literally, his case is embraced. It is, then, only a contest in his favor, that as he has left a co-defendant behind him, he is exempted. By this construction, but one is left liable, and the person removing is exempt from the reach of the execution. By the other, both remain liable, as before, and the execution may travel abroad to effectuate that liability. Between these two constructions, we choose the latter, and conceive that the execution might be rightfully issued to Franklin. *3 It seems, then, that the former opinion and judgment of this court thereon, must be set aside and annulled, and the judgment of the court below must be affirmed with costs.
