Apr. 24, 1820. *1 ON A WRIT OF ERROR TO REVERSE A DECREE OF THE FAYETTE CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Equity 150 k 429 150 Equity 150X Decree and Enforcement Thereof 150k429 k. Amendment or Modification. Most Cited Cases Where a final decree is entered at one term, the power of the court over the record ceases, and it is erroneous to render another decree at a subsequent term. JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This cause presents a phenomenon in judicial proceedings. The bill claimed a conveyance of a lot of ground, and the settlement of accounts between the parties. At the November term, 1817, the court rendered a decree completely final, dismissing the complainant's bill and decreeing the defendant his costs; on which decree an execution appears to have issued after the term expired. No other proceedings appear to have been had until the October term, 1818, when, without any appearance of the parties, another decree is entered in the same cause for the sum of $1,806.30, in favor of the complainant, together with his costs; to reverse which last decree this writ of error is prosecuted. How much extraordinary proceedings should have taken place, can not be told by the record. The latter decree must have happened by some undesigned mistake on the part of the court, arising from the negligent or improper acts of the clerk, or some of the parties. Be this as it may, it is clear the power of the court, when it had rendered a final decree and discharged the parties at one term, and that term had ended without further order, ceased over the record; and the latter decree is clearly erroneous, if not irregular and void, and must be reversed and held for naught. After a final decree at one term, a subsequent decree at another term in the same cause is anomalous and void. Wickliffe for plaintiff, Haggin for defendant. Ky.App. 1820. Bobb v.
