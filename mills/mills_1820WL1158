JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Robert M'Clure exhibited his bill in chancery, representing that on the 16th September, 1802, a written contract was entered into between John G. Brown, Richard Purcel, and George M'Clure, which reads as follows: "In case anything should happen either of us, we conceive it necessary, for the satisfaction of our friends, to make a small memorandum of our affairs, with respect to lands in the country. The land we purchased from Blackburn, whatever head rights Clarke may take up for us, also the right which Means is to procure for us in Christian--likewise what Elliot procures for us in Logan, and any other land which we may get in the counties of Warren and Barren, is to be equally the property of each of us, each paying his proportionable part of the state fees, purchase-money, &c. Signed in Warren county, Kentucky, September 16, 1802. JOHN G. BROWN, GEORGE M'CLURE. RICHARD PURCEL." The bill further suggests that some time afterwards, at furthest within two years, George M'Clure, one of the parties to the contract, died in Virginia, where he resided; and in 1804, David M'Clure, who claimed to be his heir, applied to the other two, and they, to recognise his interest, gave him a writing to the following effect: *2 "Memorandum:--Whereas, John G. Brown, Richard Purcel and George M'Clure, took up certain head rights in Christian county, Kentucky; and George M'Clure having departed this life; this is to certify, that we consider David M'Clure as fully a partner as the said George M'Clure was. Given under our hands this 17th day of March, 1804. Signed                                    JOHN G. BROWN RICHARD PURCEL." David M'Clure, on the 24th day of October, 1811, assigned his contract, except four hundred acres, for which he had received a deed, to the complainant. The bill then proceeds to charge that Brown and Purcel did, under the agreement appropriate a quantity of lands by certificate, granted by the county court of Christian, before the death of George M'Clure; and that they industriously concealed from David M'Clure the true situation of the lands, the title, names, numbers and quantity, of everything relative to them; and that they commenced assigning, transferring and making sales of the whole lands, without reserving the part of George M'Clure; and that they assigned the whole of the lands to themselves, and then to the purchasers, except one tract of 400 acres, located in the name of Richard Purcel, who still held the title. The bill then proceeds to state and an amended bill sets them out more fully, the number of eight tracts of four hundred acres each located for the partners of Clarke, named in the contract, and ten tracts, some of them containing the same quantity, and some less, by Means, who was employed. The bill then prays, that the parts still held the title of which is still in Purcel or Brown, may be assigned to the complainant, as so much for the eighteen different tracts, towards discharging his third, and that the value of the residue of his third may be ascertained and decreed to him. To this bill David M'Clure, Brown and Purcel, were made defendants, Against David M'Clure publication was made, and the bill taken pro confesso, he being a resident of Virginia. Purcel and Brown answered, admitting the contract and additional memoraudum--and that the lands were located as charged in the bill, and that they had sold all the head rights taken up by them, except the one named in the assignment, which David M'Clure had got, and one in the name of Purcel; and about the purchase from Blackburn, there appears to be no claim or controversy. The answers also rely upon the fact that all the claims exhibited as located by Clarke and Means are dated some day or two, or more, before the date of the article of partnership, and attempt to suggest, as the respondents are advised, that they can not of course be included within it. But they also allege that George M'Clure or David M'Clure did not pay any share of the expense of surveying or office fees, or any part of the state price. That they had written to David M'Clure in Virginia, requesting his portion, and that he had refused to contribute one cent; and that as it all fell upon them, who were illy able to bear it, they secured and sold what they could, and some they sold subject to the state price due thereon. An amended bill now tenders a proportion of the price and expense, and excuses its not being done before, by pleading ignorance in the complainant and David M' Clure of their right or of the claims for purchase money and expenses, in which they had been kept by the defendants, Purcel and Brown. And charges that there were no other claims located by Clarke and Means for them, except those dated before the contract, and challenges the production of any of a subsequent date. To this no futher response is given. The circu??t court dismissed the complainant's bill with costs; and from this decree the complainant has appealed; and now questions the merits of the decree. *3 The objection made against carrying this contract into effect arising from the contract being dated after the certificates were obtained from the county court cannot be availing. Neither of the defendants have dared to deny that they were the lands intended; and they have not attempted to show that there were any other lands which could be included. It is presumable either that the parties were not, at the time, apprised of what Means and Clarke had done, in execution of their agency, or that the contract was previously made and post dated, by mistake; and the latter seems to be very probable if not certain, from the proof in the cause. Be this as it may, it is evident from the terms of the contract that the parties in a very inartificial manner, were then committing to paper what was agreed upon previously, and the reference to the lands acquired by Clarke and Means was bare description of them, as opposed to those purchased from Blackburn, and those lying in other counties. The interpretation of the parties themselves, if such it can be called, contained in the instrument which recognizes David M'Clure as a party, is also very strong to show that the head rights claimed by them and interior to that date located by them, were those to which the partnership attached itself, and which they were to hold jointly. We conceive, therefore, that this objection relied on by the answers of the defendants cannot avail them. The second ground, however, on which they rely, to wit, that of a total failure of David M'Clure to furnish a proportionate share of the purchase money and expenses assumes a much more formidable shape. The deposition of Clarke is taken more than once, yet he does not prove that any part of the wages of his employment was paid by George M'Clure. He has stated that Means, who is dead, informed him that he had received his compensation from George M'Clure; but it is necessary that these declarations of Means, as agent, should compose a part of the res gestae, to make them competent. For only in that case would their effect be admissible against the defendants. This, however, does not appear to be the case; for we are left to conjecture on what occasion they were made. It no where appears in the record that George M'Clure ever advanced anything; and although the precise time of his death is somewhat uncertain, yet it is clear the event happened previous to the accruing expenses of surveying, and the necessity of discharging the state price. As to David M' Clure, it is not pretended that he ever furnished any money; and his excuse for it is, his ignorance of his rights and of the nature of the claims. To this it may be replied that he does not appear to have been ignorant of the writing itself, and was probably in his power, and perhaps in his possession, and, by its terms, it admonished him of his duty. Besides in the year 1804, he was fully recorgnized as a partner, and the presumption is fair that he was then possessed of its terms. Add to this that it is proved in the cause that he received a letter in Virginia addressed to him by the defendant Purcel, requiring money; and in reply he totally refused to advance any and sent the message that he would have nothing to do with the lands, and never until the date of the amended bill is contribution tendered. The bill of the complainant partakes of the nature of a bill for specific execution, and as to such the principle is well settled that the party asking relief must be guilty of no laches on his part. If he is, he must fully justfy it, by the conduct of his adversary rendering his failure necessary for his own safety. Here the pretended excuse is concealment of the circumstances. These circumstances might have been developed by using reasonable diligence, and he has not shown that David M'Clure or himself ever applied to the defendants for information or that ever they refused it; but, on the contrary he refused the money necesary. To permit the complainant, then, or David M' Clure, under whom he claims, to lie by supinely, when his aid was necessary, and to refuse the necessary means to secure his part, until he discovered the contract, in the course of events, had become a profitable one, and then to claim an interest in it, and offer contribution, and plead his former ignorance of what he then did not wish to know, or understand, would be going greater lengths to enforce the contract than the rules of equity will allow. On this ground, then, he is not entitled to relief. But independent of all these circumstances, there is something in the contract itself, and the various facts proved relative to it, when applied to the law under which the lands were to be taken up, which presents a formidable objection against the interposition of the chancellor in favor of either party. The law which then allowed the county courts to grant certificates, and permit locations, only gave them the power to allow any one individual four hundred acres, and that individual must be an actual settler on the spot to be located, and must remain confined to the soil afterwards for the space of two years; during which time the claim was not assignable, a provision evidently intended to secure the land for himself as a domiciled citizen, and not for another according to the construction given to the act at the present term in the case of Cates vs. Loftus. For the actual settler and resident, then,and no other, not even for his employer was the land intended. Designing to act under this law, and acquire lands by its provisions, in the present case, three individuals proved at that time, and for some time afterwards, all of them, to be residents of the state of Virginia, combine together and employ other individuals to procure head rights, not only one apiece, but the vast number of eighteen in the names of themselves and divers other individuals for their benefit, in contravention of every principle adopted by the statute; and by this means so large a portion of land beyond their allowance, and without actual settlement themselves, or those whose names they used, and who could not settle for them, if employed to do so, was monopolized, and the law evaded and defeated. Such an agreement was evidently fraudem legis, and no party to it can be entitled to the aid of a court of equity, which regards the wise policy of the law. No merit, then, can be given to the defendants more than the complainant, other than that of the attitude of defendants. One of them asserts in his answer, that, besides the state price, a good head right of four hundred acres, could then be had, in the county of Christian, for ten, twenty or thirty dollars, and that the state price was the only difficulty in obtaining a tract. This assertion, if true, proves one or all of three things--either that labor, settlement and residence for two years could be procured, against law, at a very low rate--or that perjury was then extremely cheap--or that the county court, then the ministers or sentinels of the law, was asleep at their post. *4 The declarations of a deceased agent should form a part of the res gestae between the parties litigant, to be competent evidence against either. In a contract for the acquisition of lands entered into by 3, in which it is agreed that each shall contribute ratably, if one of the party refuses or unreasonably delays his contribution, he will not be entitled to a specific execution, unless the delay or refusal was necessary to his own safety. The law authorizing the county courts to grant head rights of 400 acres, restricted the exercise of that power to the grant of a single claim to any individual, who must be an actual settler at the time, and continue to reside thereon for two years thereafter, without assigning his claim; in the absence of any of these requisites, the grant is void. Neither party to an agreement in fraud of the law, is entitled to the aid of the chancellor. The decision of the court below must be affirmed with costs.
