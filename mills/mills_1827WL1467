[Absent Chief Justice Bibb.] Question stated. The only question in these two cases is, can a defendant to a suit on a bond given to the United States, to secure her revenue, plead or set up by way of defence, that he had compounded the matter with the collector of that revenue, by paying him so much whisky, which was accepted by him, in discharge of the bond? The collector no doubt had authority to collect this revenue, in the specific thing secured by the bond; but we are aware of no authority conferred upon collectors to compromise the claims of the govenment, and place in the mouths of her debtors, the plea of accord and satisfaction. The collector is the agent of the government, and must pursue the powers conferred upon him, and if he acts without the scope of his authority, he can not bind his principal, but must become responsible to the defendant on his agreement, and the government be allowed to collect her claims, unembarrassed by his unauthorized contracts. In an action of the United States, on a bond given to secure her revenue, plea of accord with the collector, and delivery to him of whiskey in satisfaction, is no defence-- --Collectors may collect the money, but can not make a commutation so as to affect the government. Each judgment must therefore be affirmed with costs and damages. Mayes, for appellant; Crittenden, district attorney, for the United States. Ky.App. 1827. Martin's Adm'r v.
