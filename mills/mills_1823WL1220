CRITTENDEN for appellant; MONROE and SHARP for appellees. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. In this case an execution and replevin bond were quashed by a judgment of the court below, on a writ of error coram vorbis. One, at least, of the errors assigned in that court, if true, was sufficient to quash the execution and bond, to wit, that the execution issued against two persons, both of whom had joined in the replevin, when the original judgment was against one only. There is no exception to the opinion of the court, nor is the judgment produced to show that this error is false. Of course, we must presume that the court below did right in deciding as it has done. If the judgment is against one, and the execution on it and replevin bond against two, both ought to be quashed. The court of appeals must presume that error sufficient in law to have quashed an execution, did not exist in fact, if the inferior court overruled the motion to quash, and the transcript of the record does not show that the error existed in fact. The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed with costs. Ky.App. 1823. Morrel v. Barner 4 Litt. 10, 14 Ky. 10, 1823 WL 1220 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
