Most  Cited Cases (Formerly 134k280) A husband against whom a divorce has been granted is entitled to a writ of error from that part of the decree dividing his estate and granting alimony to the wife. BIBB for plaintiff; LITTELL for defendant. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. This is a writ of error to reverse a decree, which after granting a divorce, divided the estate, in favor of the wife against the husband, and the object of the writ is to revise that part of the proceedings which divided the estate. It is contended that the writ of error will not lie for that purpose, and that it ought to be quashed. There can be no doubt that no writ of error can reach the decree granting a divorce; for the act of assembly regulating writs of error, expressly precludes a writ of error from reaching a decree of the kind. It has also been decided by this court, in the case of Simpson v. Simpson, that an appeal from a decree granting a divorce only, without any division of estate, would not lie, and an appeal was dismissed, because it was not for a sum of money, equal to what the act of assembly requires, to authorize this court to revise by an appeal, nor did it relate to a franchise or freehold. But this court on an appeal in the case of Fichli v. Fichli, from a decree of divorce accompanied with a decree for money, or the division of estate, did entertain jurisdiction, and reverse that part of it which decreed money. In like manner we conceive that this court by writ of error, may review the decree dividing the estate, although we are precluded from disturbing that part which grants a divorce. It is true, the divorce and division of the estate may be written in one decree; but it is equally true, that the subjects are different and may or may not be so blended, and each requires a different adjudication from the court below; and, therefore, we conceive that only so much as directs a divorce, is taken from this court on a writ of error. Such a construction is more consistent with the evils intended to be remedied by the act. The writ of error might be delayed for three years; the case might be depending for some time here, and then a reversal might restore the relation of man and wife, when one of them might in the mean time be married to another, and also, the issue of the second marriage, might be rendered either illegitimate, or at least possess a standing unparalleled and doubtful. To avoid these evils the act was passed, and none of them can arise from reversing the division of the estate between the parties. *2 A writ of error will lie from that part of a decree in a divorce case, which relates to the division of the state. In revising such decree, the court of appeals will look into the evidence, to see whether the case was a meritorious one on the part of the applicant, and no further. Where a divorce has been obtained by the wife, and her conduct is blameless, an allowance, equal to what the law gives her on the death of her husband, is reasonable. We, therefore, leaving the divorce untouched, and only looking into the evidence on which it was founded, so far as may be necessary to see whether it is a meritorious case on the part of the complainant, shall proceed to examine the division of estate which was made by the court below. The parties are aged and had lived together about thirty-five years, and raised a considerable number of children, most of whom had arrived at years of discretion before this bill was filed. By their joint exertions, in which the complainant below seems to have borne her full share, they have amassed a competent estate of land, slaves and chattels, which does not appear to be much embarrassed. The separation does appear to be caused by the unprovoked and harsh treatment of the defendant below, continued for a series of years to a most unaccountable excess, and the case is one of an aggravated character on his part. The circuit court took exactly the rule which the law would have taken in case the defendant below had died, that is, assigned to her one-third of the lands and slaves in value for her life, and one-third of the chattels forever. We can not say that the allowance is inequitable; for no good reason can be assigned why, if she is compelled to a separation, not by her own fault, but entirely by the ill conduct of her husband, that she should receive less than if he had been taken from her by death. Indeed, so far as her standing in society is concerned, the latter is the preferable case. In this, she might live the respected widow; in that, she must remain the repudiated wife, in the eyes of the unthinking world. We, therefore, see no reason for disturbing the decree, and it must be affirmed with costs. Ky.App. 1823. Thornberry v. Thornberry 4 Litt. 251, 14 Ky. 251, 1823 WL 1268 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
