OPINION OF THE COURT BY JUDGE MILLS. This is an action of debt, brought by the appellant, as relator, after he came of full age, against the appellees, one as principal and the other as security, on a bond executed by the principal as guardian for the relator. Action on guardian' bond. The declaration, after setting out both the penalty and condition of the bond, (both which were in usual form), sets out for breach that the guardian had "not well and truly collected and accounted for and paid over to his ward, divers large sums of money, to-wit: $520, which was due and owing to said ward, while the said appellee Miller, was his guardian, from Gabriel J. Johnston, due by note, dated 16th July, 1817, payable to said Miller as guardian for his said ward, within four months after its date, and also $127.50, due and owing to said ward, whilst said Miller was his guardian, but failed and refused to collect said sums of the said Gabriel J. Johnston, until by reason of said negligence on part of said guardian, the said sums were entirely lost to the ward, he, the said Gabriel J. Johnston, having in the mean time become utterly insolvent." Declaration assigning breach in the condition of the bond. To this declaration the defendant below pleaded: first, "conditions performed," in usual form, to which the plaintiff replied, generally, that said conditions were not performed, and secondly, a special plea, to the following effect: Plea, conditions performed and replication. *2 "That after the relator of the plaintiff had attained his full age, it was accorded and agreed by and between him and defendant, that the defendant should deliver to the said plaintiff, the note of Gabriel J. Johnston for $    and  the note of John T. Gray, for the sum of $    in full satisfaction for and on  account of all damages to which plaintiff was or might be entitled for having failed to collect the notes in the declaration mentioned, and that in pursuance of said accord, he did then and there deliver said notes in full satisfaction for the failure to collect them as aforesaid, and he then and there received them." Special plea. There was another special plea filed previous to this; but it was demurred to, and overruled on demurrer, and as it was rightly disposed of and involves no new question, we shall not notice it. To the special plea which we have recited, the relator of the plaintiff replied: Replication to the special plea. "That he ought not to be barred because he says that the defendant Miller, (formerly his guardian), having in his possession the notes in the plea alluded to, requested him, the relator, to receive said notes and carry them to New-Castle, where said Gabriel J. Johnston then resided, and to present them to said Gabriel J. Johnston, for payment, and if he did not pay the same, then to return them to the defendant Miller, and avers that he received said notes for the purpose of presenting them as aforesaid, to said Gabriel J. Johnston, and did so present them; but said Gabriel J. Johnston refused and failed to pay them or any part thereof, and that afterwards he returned said notes to said defendant Miller, who received and still holds them." To this replication the defendant rejoined: "That the defendant Miller did not request plaintiff to receive said notes and carry them to New-Castle, where said Gabriel J. Johnston resided, and present them to him for payment, and if he did not pay them to return them to said Miller, and he denies plaintiff received them for said purpose, and that afterwards plaintiff returned said notes, and that he received them and yet has them." Rejoinder of defendants. This rejoinder concluded to the country, and the plaintiff filed a similiter, and a jury was sworn to try the issues. Issue. On the trial it appeared that the defendant Miller became guardian for the relator of the plaintiff, in May, 1817, and then executed bond, on which this suit is brought, and the relator left the State shortly afterwards, and was not in it till his arrival at full age, in July, 1821, That Gabriel J. Johnston was owing about $647.50, and to secure the same, he executed his note to the guardian, in July, 1817, payable four months after date, for $520.50, and for the payment of the remaining $127.50, passed to plaintiff, by delivery without assignment, the note of John T. Gray, executed to said Gabriel J. Johnston, but that said note of Gray was paid to said Gabriel J. Johnston by Gray, before its delivery to the guardian in security for the debt due to his ward; that in 1819, a common friend of the parties apprised the guardian, of his own mere motion, that Gabriel J. Johnston was embarrassed and was about to make over and convey away all his property, and urged the guardian to pursue him speedily, and secure the debts due to him as guardian for plaintiff, which he, the guardian, promised to do; that Gabriel J. Johnston failed in the latter part of the year 1819, and large sums of money were made out of his estate, by execution, during the year 1820; that the defendant, the former guardian, had, long before this suit was brought, held and still holds the said notes of Gabriel J. Johnston and Gray, on which no efforts to collect the money appears to have been made. *3 Evidence on the trial, on plaintiff's part. To rebut this, the defendant proved that the relator of the plaintiff, to whose estate the debt was due, was the brother of the said Gabrel J. Johnston, and while an infant, had requested his said guardian not to sue the said Gabriel J. Johnston for the aforesaid debt; and that after his coming of age, in July, 1821, he had shewed kindness to the said Gabrel J. Johnston in his distress, by turning a tenant of his out of doors, and permitting the said Gabriel J. Johnston to reside in the house, and had also lent the said Gabriel J. Johnston some money. The defendant further gave in evidence the following receipt of the relator of the plaintiff, dated 20th of August, 1823. Defendant's evidence. "Received of Isaac Miller, John T. Gray's obligation to Gabriel J. Johnston, for one hundred and twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents, due November, 1817, also Gabriel J. Johnston's note for five hundred and twenty dollars, bearing date the 16th of July, 1817, due in four months, which were delivered to said Miller as guardian for me, by Gabriel J. Johnston. (Signed)                                  T. I. JOHNSTON. The remaining evidence in the cause, consists of the declaration of the parties, and is introduced as an attempt to explain pro. and con. for what purpose this receipt was given, and how the notes after the date of this receipt, got back into the hands of the guardian. The relator seemed by these declarations, to be under some apprehensions that this receipt might bar his recovery against his guardian, and to show some anxiety to get the notes back in his possession. The court below, on the application of the defendants, instructed the jury, that unless they should believe from the evidence, that the said notes of Gabriel J. Johnston and John T. Gray were delivered by defendant Miller to, and received by, relator of plaintiff, to present to Gabriel J. Johnston for payment, and if he did not pay them, to return them to said Miller, they were bound to find for defendants, and that the proof of the above facts lay upon the relator of the plaintiff." Instructions of the circuit court. The jury found for the defendants, and the plaintiff moved for a new trial, relying on the grounds, that the court had misdirected the jury, and that the verdict was against both law and evidence. The court overruled this motion, and the plaintiff by exception spread all this matter on the record and has appealed to this court. Verdict for defendant; motion for new trial overruled and exception. We can not sustain the instructions of the court below, even if it could be conceded that the issue joined was in substance an issue upon the inquiry whether these notes were received by the relator, as an accord and satisfaction for the damages which had accrued to the relator by the negligence of the guardian. For the instruction excludes the idea of satisfaction altogether, and rests the event upon the fact, whether the notes were or were not taken to be presented for payment to Gabriel J. Johnston and to be returned, although they might have been taken for many other purposes, besides satisfaction for the demand. This pivot on which the controversy is made to turn, was wholly immaterial to the real contest. The truth is, the parties had widely departed by their pleadings from the point whence they started, and their evidence still farther deviated from the real inquiry, and the instruction of the court discharged the defendants because the plaintiff did not affirmatively prove a fact which was wholly unnecessary to make out his right of action, or insure his recovery. *4 Evidence to sustain a plea of accord and satisfaction, by the delivery of promissory notes on others, the proof must be of the delivery, and acceptance in satisfaction, and evidence shewing there was not an agreement, the notes might be returned if not collected, is not sufficient. It could be of no avail to the defendant that the relator had shewn kindness to Gabriel J. Johnston, and it was of less avail that he was told by the relator when an infant, to abstain, from recovering these debts from Gabriel J. Johnston. If when a minor, he was competent to direct when suits should or should not be brought to recover his estate, then a guardian to act for him would be useless, and if a guardian could thus protect himself from liability for either fraud or negligence, there are but few thus liable, who could not have the address to procure from their unsuspicious and ignorant wards, the approbation, or even direction, for such negligence and fraud. Proof that the ward whilst within age requested the guardian to abstain from recovering a demand against a debtor, is no defense to an action for the omission to make the collection. The receipt of the relator of the plaintiff for these notes, which his guardian had neglected to enforce, appears on its face, also, to furnish no substantial defence, or to be evidence warranting either the instruction of the court or the verdict of the jury thereon. It is a simple acknowledgement that he had received these notes. If he did so receive them, he had a right to them, and they were his in conscience. He might take them, and try to collect them if he could, and if he failed, resort to his guardian for their value, if his negligence had been the cause of his failure. There were then no grounds for the fears of the relator, that he had lost his action by taking these notes, or for the hopes of the defendants that the guardian was released by the same act. If then it be true, that the guardian had made himself liable by failing to collect these notes, as his second plea seems to admit, it was certain the relator's receiving the notes for any other purpose than to collect their amounts, and to return them if he failed in that collection, or for any other purpose, could not discharge that liability, as the instruction of the court below seems to have told the jury. Acceptance by the ward, after full age, of the promissory notes, the guardian had failed to collect, and thereby become liable for the amount, is not, unless collected, a satisfaction of the damages the ward might be entitled to on the guardian bond, for the negligence. The truth is, the last issue, (if not also the first), on which the parties went to trial, was wholly immaterial, and a court by instructions ought not to aid a party who attempts to defeat a legal claim by an immaterial issue. Issue on such a plea is immaterial, and no instruction in relation to it ought to be given on the trial. On the return of the cause to the court below, a repleader must necessarily be awarded, and it is necessary that we should direct at what point it should commence. Not only the rejoinder and replication to the last plea must be stricken out, but also the plea itself. For if it be conceded that an accord and satisfaction can be pleaded in this action of debt (a point not easily supported by authority), this plea can not be sustained. *5 Query--Can an accord and satisfaction be pleaded in an action on a guardian's bond? It does not allege in express terms in the first part of it, that the notes delivered in satisfaction of the plaintiff's cause of action, are the evidences of the same debts, for the loss of which, by the supposed negligence of the guardian, the action is brought; but there is a strong inference that they are the same, and the close of the plea comes out with the fact in terms too plain to be mistaken by charging that the guardian delivered said notes in full satisfaction, "for the failure to collect them," that is, when interpreted, the relator was so obliging as to accept the evidence of his own demands in discharge of further claims for these demands, which as admitted by the plea, were already lost by the negligence of the guardian. A satisfaction must be of some value; but according to this plea the relator received notes of no value, and those notes before that his own property, in discharge of his cause of action. The plea, therefore, is a nullity and must, in forming a new issue, be disregarded. It is but a struggle, on the part of the defendants, to sustain the same fact, which they used in evidence; that is, that the bare taking these notes by the relator, acquitted the guardian of liability on account of them. Delivery to the ward, by the guardian, of the bond, for the failure to collect which an action had accrued, can be no satisfaction of the damages. As the issue is to be new modelled, we can not help suggesting the facility with which the issue might be formed, by a withdrawal of the replication to the first plea, as well as the plea itself, and the formation of an issue or issues, by direct and special answers to the breaches of the condition of the bond, as assigned in the declaration; and this is the proper course to be taken in all such cases, instead of permitting the defendant to answer special breaches, by the general allegation of "conditions performed." To a declaration on a bond with conditions assigning special breaches, the plea ought to answer the breaches specially, and not in general terms; covenants performed. The ancient and strictly correct practice on similar bonds, was to declare on the penalty, without noticing the condition. To answer this, the defendant craved oyer of the bond and condition thereof, and pleaded conditions performed. In reply to this, the plaintiff set out special breaches, which the defendant was compelled to answer specially, instead of absurdly repeating in his rejoinder, "conditions performed." Mode of declaring on bonds with conditions. In this country, the plaintiff frequently sets out both the bond and condition, and assigns special breaches in the declaration, and on bonds such as this, where the action is brought by a relator, this perhaps becomes necessary, in order to shew the relator's title to sue on the bond, founded on the injury he has sustained. But whenever this is done, it is evident that the plaintiff anticipates a stage of the cause at the close of his declaration, which, according to the former practice, would be still distant; that is, at the close of his declaration, according to this practice, he is at the same point which he would be at, according to the ancient method, at the close of his replication; and it thence follows that the defendant ought to be compelled to give as special an answer to the declaration thus drawn, as in the former method he would be compelled to give to the replication assigning the breaches for the first time, instead of the general answer of "conditions performed," which only fits the case before the breaches are assigned at all. *6 Where the bond is to the commonwealth, and the action by a relator, how the declaration shall be framed. It remains yet to be decided how far such a general plea to a declaration with breaches assigned can be sustained. If it can, it must be after its general allegations are cured by a verdict. "Conditions performed," to a declaration assigning special breaches, is ill, on demurrer--and query, of the effect of the verdict. The judgment is therefore reversed, with costs, and the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for new proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion.
