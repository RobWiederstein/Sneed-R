OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. The object of Galloway's bill being to subject land held by Hamilton, to the payment of a debt contracted by Moore, in purchasing the land from Galloway, it was irregular to hear and decide the cause upon the merits without the apparance of Moore, or the service of process upon him, though it would have been competent for the court, in consequence of Hamilton's failure to bring Moore before the court, to have dismissed the bill without prejudice to any other suit. In the bill of vendor of land, to subject it to payment of the purchase money, a sub-purchaser must be made party. But, as instead of doing so, the bill was absolutely dismissed, the decree must be reversed, the cause remanded to the court below, and a decree entered, dismissing the bill without prejudice, to the right of Galloway in any future suit. Bill dismissed absolutely, when it ought to have been without prejudice; decree reversed. Each party must pay their own costs in this court. Costs refused. Triplett, for plaintiff. Ky.App. 1826.
