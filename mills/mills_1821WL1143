Most Cited  Cases In motions to quash a delivery bond and execution thereon, all the obligors must be parties. JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT. This is a motion to quash a delivery bond and execution thereon, which was sustained by the court below, for errors apparent on its face. The motion was made by the security only, without reciting the principal in the bond. It has already been decided in this court, that a writ of error coram vobis, must combine all the parties to a bond, and that all the obligors must join. The same principle ought to apply to and govern motions of this character, which are concurrent remedies, in some measure at least, with the writ of error coram vobis, and supply its place. It was then necessary that the principal should join, or it will compel the opposite party to litigate the same matter as many times as there are obligors. The motion for this cause ought not to have been sustained and decided on the merits. In motion to quash forthcoming bonds, all the obligors must be parties. The judgment is therefore reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, with directions there to quash the notice with costs. Ky.App. 1821. Bank of Kentucky v.
