In General. Most Cited  Cases To authorize the appellate court to revise a decision on a question of fact, all the evidence upon which the court below acted must be brought up. JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: *1 This is an appeal from a judgment rendered for improvements, under the occupying claimant laws. One item in the report of commissioners was objected to, but the exception rested on matters of fact, dehors the record. The court, after hearing the evidence, overruled the objection. No bill of exceptions was sealed, shewing what evidence was introduced--of course the presumption is that the court below decided right. No exception, resting on matters of fact, dehors the record, can be noticed unless the facts are set forth in the exception, the opinion of the court below will be presumed to be correct. The judgment is therefore affirmed with damages and costs. Ky.App. 1821. Taylor v. Chapline 3 A.K.Marsh. 491, 10 Ky. 491, 1821 WL 1142 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
