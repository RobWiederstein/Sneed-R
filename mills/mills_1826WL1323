This is a writ of error to reverse a decree in chancery, perpetuating an injunction, and decreeing the restoration of a sum of money. The decree was rendered on taking the bill pro confesso after order of publication returned against the defendant below as a non resident. The following certificate, annexed to a copy of the order of publication, is the only evidence that the publication was ever made. "Farmer's Chronicle Office. I certify that the annexed advertisements of Jesse Benton, against Elisha Evans, has been published for two months successively, in the Farmer's Chronicle, commencing April 29th, 1825, expiring June 29th, 1825, Given under my hand this 2d day of July, 1825. This court will take judicial notice that certain persons are officers without their names of office appearing in their acts.--But It must appear on the face of the certificate of the insertion of the order of publication in the newspaper, that the person certifying is the editor. JOSEPH TURNER." This certificate is too defective, to warrant the decree. Formerly, such proof was made by affidavit, and now the legislature has allowed the bare certificate of the editor or publisher of the paper to be sufficient, and he may certify the fact, as an officer may do in many cases. It is true, that this court will take judicial notice that certain persons are officers of government, even when the name of office is not inserted in their official acts. But it would certainly be extending this principle very far, to say that a court should judicially know is editor of a public print, which is a bare employment or calling, and not an office. It is therefore essential that the certificate should show on its face, that it is made by the editor, who conducts the paper. It does not appear from this certificate, that the editor had any hand in making it, or that it was not made by some other person in the office. The decree for this defect, must be reversed with costs, and the cause be remanded for new proceedings, commencing with the proof of the order of publication. *2 Mandate.
