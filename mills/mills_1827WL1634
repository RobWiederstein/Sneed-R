ERROR TO THE ROCKCASTLE CIRCUIT; JOSEPH EVE, JUDGE. West Headnotes Execution 161 k 158(2) 161 Execution 161IX Relief Against Execution 161k158 Stay of Execution 161k158(2) k. Bond or Other Security. Most Cited  Cases Since the replevin bond taken by a sheriff on an execution indorsed payable in paper of the bank of the commonwealth is required by act of the assembly to be taken payable in paper, a bond taken on such an execution payable in dollars only is invalid. OPINION OF THE COURT BY JUDGE MILLS. On a note, given expressly payable in Commonwealth's paper, the plaintiff below proceeded under the act of assembly, to recover the amount specifically in paper, and after judgment, execution issued endorsed accordingly. The sheriff took a replevin bond not payable in paper but in dollars only. The obligors of this bond moved to quash it, and the court overruled the motion, from which the obligors have appealed. Replevin bond on an execution endorsed for commonwealth paper issued on a judgment for the paper, must be taken for the bank paper, specifically, and being taken for dollars, no more saying, may be quashed. The act of assembly under which these proceedings were had, allows the plaintiff to take his judgment, expressly payable in paper of the bank of the Commonwealth; directs that the execution shall be so endorsed, and that the sheriff shall take the bond payable in paper; and this bond was certainly invalid, when taken otherwise, especially as it bound the obligors, to pay more than they were bound to pay, and for this reason the bond ought to be quashed. Judgment reversed with costs, and cause remanded with directions to quash the bond with costs. Triplett, for plaintiff; Mayes, for defendant. Ky.App. 1827. Anderson v.
