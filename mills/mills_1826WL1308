The complainant below, now appellant, filed his bill alleging that he had the eldest patent and a special entry on a tract of land, and had had twenty years' undisturbed possession thereof; that the appellee, Chiles, had a junior patent covering the same, and some adjoining land, and had brought an action of ejectment against others outside of his boundary, and had named his tenant, as one of the tenants in possession, but had never served the notice and declaration upon his tenant or himself; that the other tenants had entered themselves defendants, and a recovery was had against them, and that when the writ of possession was sued out, it was against his tenant, also, and Chiles had threatened to execute it upon his tenant. He prayed an injunction, and that Chiles might be compelled to release his claim. On demurrer, the court dissolved the injunction and dismissed the bill with costs; from which decree he has appealed. We agree with the court below that, from the complainant's own statements, he had no need of an injunction, that if there was no judgment either against him or tenant, the writ could not affect him, and that if there was an attempt to execute the writ on his possession, he had ample remedy in a court of law, which could correct the abuse of its own process. But still we think that the court erred in dismissing the bill. For an act of assembly of this state expressly authorizes the holder of an elder grant, to file his bill against a junior patentee, and to try the merits of, and procure a release of the younger patent, and the bill of the complainant substantially makes out a case within the statute. *2 Bill by elder patentee in possession against the junior for injunction to the execution of a habere facias against his tenant, against whom there was no judgment, and for release of the claim. --Held that there could be no injunction to such an execution. --But the bill is maintainable under the statute for a release of the junior patentee's claim. The decree is, therefore, reversed with costs, the cause remanded, for new proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion. Triplett for plaintiff; Mayes, for defendant. Ky.App. 1826. Jones v.
