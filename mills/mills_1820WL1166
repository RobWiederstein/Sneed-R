JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is an action of trespass, for entering the close of the plaintiff, now defendant in error, and taking and carrying away a wagon and horse. The defendant below, now plaintiff in error, pleaded, not guilty, and, by consent, was to give any matter in evidence which might have been specially pleaded in bar. On the trial, it appeared that the defendant was constable of that county; and that on the 18th May, 1811, a certain William Robins placed in the defendants hands, for collection, two notes executed by a certain David Vancleve to one Jack Prior, and assigned to Joseph Robins for the payment of money. No assignment appeared on either of the notes from Joseph to William Robins; and the constable, on the reception of these notes, executed to said William Robins a receipt for them, engaging to collect and account for them according to law. This receipt, on the 9th July, 1818, William Robins assigned to Porter and Young, merchants, expressing value received. The constable procured warrants on each note, and obtained judgments thereon against Vancleve; and on the emanation of executions, they were replevied by Vancleve, with Field, the present defendant in error, as security in the replevin bonds. When executions of fieri facias issued on the bonds, the constable, not finding any estate of Vancleve, levied them on the wagon and horse in the declaration mentioned, the property of Field, and advertised and sold the said property at his house, never having removed it; and on the same day the officer behaved orderly and peaceably. Field, on the day of sale, furnished one of the bidders with the money to purchase the property; and that bidder bought the property for Field, and paid for it with Field's money. And this is the same entry and taking relied on as the trespass for which the suit was brought. The facts which are relied on to make the officer a trespasser, are the following: Some short time before the sale, a certain Charles Eastin, a brother-in-law of Vancleve, as he deposed, when introduced as a witness for the plaintiff below, now defendant in error, purchased of Joseph Robins the judgments or demands, and received from him a writting addresed to the constable to the following effect: *2 "Mr. Francis Millar--Whereas, I have this day assigned to Charles Eastin, the two judgments in your hands obtained some time since against David Vancleve; this is therefore to authorize you upon the receipt of all costs, to stop all further proceedings thereupon. Given under my hand and seal this 11th day of August, 1818. Signed,                                   JOSEPH ROBINS, (Seal.)" Eastin further deposed that some time before the sale he offered to pay up all costs, but insisted to go on and collect the money, as he was indemnified, and had given his receipt to William Robins. That he, Eastin, when he received said assignment, executed his note to Joseph Robins for about eighty or ninety dollars, the amount of the debts, which note was not yet paid off;that at the time of his purchase of the judgments he had no knowledge or notice of the transfer of the receipt by William Robins to Porter and Young. It was further proved by others that on the day of sale, Field, the defendant in error, offered to pay up the costs to the constable, and forbade the sale. But the constable insisted that his receipt was out for the money, and that he would, and did, go on. Upon the subject of the transfer or assignment of the constable's receipt to Porter and Young, the evidence is somewhat contradictory as to the nature of it. The assignment itself is absolute and unconditional. But the store keeper of Porter and Young deposed that William Robins took up goods to the amount of the receipt and made the assignment; but that it was agreed that if Joseph Robins called on Porter and Young for the receipt, before the money was collected, it was to be given up to him; and that Porter and Young was to go on and collect the money if Joseph Robins did not call. Another witnes present deposed that the bargain was, if the contract between Joseph and William Robins was not confirmed, the receipt was to be returned. Other witnesses present at the same transaction, deposed that they heard no condition in the contract; but understood it that the transfer was absolute and that the receipt was given in payment for the goods.-- The only evidence touching the contract between William and Joseph Robins was this--one witness deposed, that Joseph Robins had offered to sell him the notes and he had refused to take them, not believing Vancleve, the maker, to be good, and he conceived that the recourse to the assignor was then lost; that afterwards hearing they were transferred to William Robins, he met with Joseph Robins a short time previous to the assignment to Eastin, and asked him how he came to let William Robins cheat him out of the notes. To which Joseph Robins replied that William Robins was good for the amount; that he had property at a place mentioned, and he could make his money out of him. This being all the evidence in the cause, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff of one hundred and twenty dollars. The counsel for defendant moved the court for a new trial on the grounds that the verdict was against law and evidence; and also on the grounds of surprise and the discovery of new evidence obviating that surprise, set forth in affidavits which will be hereafter noticed. The court overruled the motion and the defendant in that court excepted and spread the evidence upon record and now prosecutes this writ of error to reverse the judgment. *3 Before considering the question of a new trial we will first dispose of a previous question made as to the competency of Eastin as a witness. The admission of him was objected to on the score of interest as developed in the foregoing facts; but the objection was overruled and the opinion excepted to. We do not conceive that his interest in the present matter of controversy was made to appear sufficiently to exclude him. For he claims to be, and stands as an assignee of the judgments on which the execution issued acting under which the officer is accused of having committed the trespass. His assignment either entitled him to the money, or it did not. If it did his right to it in the hands of the officer could not be weakened by the verdict in this action; or he was entitled to the replevin bonds, as if they were never extinguished. If so, no finding of the jury between the officer and the present defendant in error could affect that right. If he was entitled to the demand and it belonged to Porter and Young no verdict in this action could give him the right to it. It is well settled that it must be a certain interest in the event of the suit which will exclude a witness. Less than this goes to his credit of which the jury is to judge. We do not perceive any certain interest which could result to the witness on the event of this suit made out in evidence. We therefore conceive he was properly admitted. The interest of a witness, to exclude his testimony, must be direct in the issue of the suit. On the question of the verdict being against law and evidence, it cannot result favorably to the defendant in error. The question of title to these judgments or executions as between Porter and Young on one side and, Charles Eastin on the other, appears to be involved in the controversy. It is attempted to be proved by the plaintiff in error that Joseph Robins had previously transferred the notes to William Robins and he to Porter and Young. To do this he introduces the circumstance of the possession of the notes in William and the acknowledgements of Joseph. On the other hand it is contended that they belonged to Eastin by subsequent purchase of the judgment. Let them belong to whichsoever they may, it is certain neither can have more than an equitable right. For no assignment to vest the legal estate was made to William Robins; but the notes passed by delivery only, and he assigned the receipt of the officer to Porter and Young. Joseph Robins assigned the judgment to Eastin, and judgments are not made assignable by law so that at best he held but an equity. The question then results could an equity in the demand be noticed by the officer? and will a court of law so notice it as to protect him while acting under the authority of the holder of that equity? We conceive both these questions must be answered in the affirmative. This court has already gone far in supporting the doctrine that the equitable holder of a demand or judgment will be noticed in a court of law so far as to protect him against any direct attempts of the legal title holder, to prejudice his interest. *4 A judgment is not assignable at law. An officer may obey the commands of the holder of an equitable interest in a judgment, and the court will protect him in it. If this principle is sound it evidently follows from it, that officers ought to be protected in effectuating the rights of the holders of such equitable claims, if they can show those claims well founded. William Robins, in this instance, was evidently trusted with the custody of these notes of Joseph; for it cannot be presumed that he came by them improperly. To him the officer created the obligation to collect and account. Put the case then in the strongest attitude for the defendant in error, and say, as one witness has proved, that the receipt was transferred to Porter and Young to be returned in case the contract (supposed to be the contract for the note) was confirmed between Joseph and William Robins; it is proved that a short period before the assignment to Eastin, Joseph Robins adhered to the contract and by his declarations held William responsible, not for the notes themselves, but the amount for which he alleged William was good, and which he conceived he could get out of the property held by him at some distant point. If the defendant in error can in any manner succeed it must be by setting up the authority of Joseph Robins to Eastin; and thus claiming a right under Joseph Robins, he must be bound by his previous acknowledgements of his claim for the notes against William Robins. Suppose the bargain to be that Porter and Young was to collect the money, if Joseph Robins did not previously call upon Porter and Young for the receipt; no evidence was adduced to show that he ever called upon Porter and Young for the receipt; but his declarations above alluded to are adduced distinctly announcing his claim against William Robins for the payment of the notes, which he had let him have. Take the evidence, then, as strong for the defendant in error as it can be made, we conceive the officer made out a valid equity in Porter and Young, derived mediately from Joseph Robins, which might have justified him in proceeding, notwithstanding the equity of Eastin, which is of later date. For even if the equity of Eastin be equal, yet it is a rule in equities that when both are equal that shall prevail which is prior to date. On this ground therefore we do not conceive the verdict can be supported. Where the equity between two or more assignees is equal, that shall prevail which is prior in date. But there is a still further ground against this verdict, which is a defect of proof in an essential point. It may be a question of some moment, in case the plaintiff and defendant in an execution make an arrangement by which the debt is to be otherwise discharged, or the proceedings to be staid, and the plaintiff gives the defendant an order to the officer to stay further proceedings after he had levied, and the officer was still to proceed, how far the officer having commenced under proper authority, would be trespaser by relation or ab initio, at the suit of the defendant. This is not necessary for us now to decide. For put the case that the officer would, under such circumstances, be liable to the defendant in an action of trespass, it would be certainly necessary, in such case, for the defendant in the execution, if he had not paid the debt, to show that he derived his authority from the plaintiff to the officer, and that the orders were given from the plaintiff for his benefit; otherwise it would be a question more properly between the plaintiff and the officer and the defendant who owed and was bound to pay the debt, could not complain of being injured by being compelled to do so. Admit then the equity of Eastin in the present instance was superior to that of Porter and Young, it was certainly necessary for the plaintiff below, now the defendant in error, to show that the purchase of Eastin was for his benefit, and that the order of Joseph Robins was to protect him from the sale. This he has wholly failed to do. If Eastin in this case after receiving this order, had directed the officer to proceed, if his title was good, the execution was for his benefit, and he had a right to do so, and the defendant in error would be bound to no more than, what he was before, that is, to pay his debt for the benefit of Eastin. No authority, then, is shown from either Joseph Robins or Eastin to the defendant in error to stop the proceedings of the officer, and the want of this leaves out an essential link in the chain of the facts necessary to support the action in law. *5 The only remaining grounds for a new trial is that made out by the affidavits. The defendant below, now plaintiff in error, deposed that although he knew no witnesses by whom he could prove it, yet it was confidently believed that Eastin had knowledge of the claim of Porter and Young to the notes before his purchase, and that he would not deny it; and that he, the then defendant, was surprised at the trial by his swearing that he had no knowledge of their claim. That since the trial he had discovered two witnesses, of whom before he had no knowledge, who would prove that both Eastin and Joseph Robins had knowledge of the transfer from William Robins to Porter and Young, and that Eastin had given his note for only about thirty or fifty dollars for the debt. He produces the affidavits of these witnesses, and they fully support his statement. A new trial should seldom be granted on the discovery of evidence that goes to support points which were presented to the jury on the former trial. It is a correct rule, that new trials on account of the discovery of new testimony, consisting of the swearing of witnesses, ought seldom to be granted, especially when the newly discovered evidence goes to points on which the party adduced evidence, and had prepared himself. The presumption is then violent, that he might have previously discovered the witnesses on using reasonable diligence. Besides, to admit the discovery of new witnesses, after a party is under the pressure of a verdict, presents a strong temptation to the procurement of witnesses by improper means. But cases may be found presenting good exceptions to the rule; and we conceive the surprise occasioned by the swearing of a witness on a trial to facts, which the party, against whom he was called, would not suppose or believe he would swear, as in this instance may furnish one of these exceptions, in a case like the present, where the affidavits of the newly discovered witnesses are produced, and show, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the statements of the witness Eastin can be contradicted, and that his claim probably originated in collusion between himself and Joseph Robins to defeat the claim of Porter and Young. Add to this that the officer could not have been placed on his guard on this point, or the presumption is strong that he would have adduced evidence upon it; and that he acted as an officer, and could have had no other motive to proceed as he did under the executions, but a punctual discharge of his duty. For his fees could not have tempted him, as they were offered to him both by Eastin and the defendant in error. We therefore conceive that the court erred in refusing to grant a new trial, and that the judgment must be reversed with costs, and the verdict set aside, with directions to the court below to reinstate the cause and proceed therein not inconsistent with this opinion.
