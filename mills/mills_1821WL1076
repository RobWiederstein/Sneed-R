Apr. 12, 1821. *1 ON A WRIT OF ERROR TO REVERSE A JUDGMENT OF THE HENRY CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Attachment 44 k 131 44 Attachment 44III Proceedings to Procure 44III(C) Security 44k131 k. Amount. Most Cited Cases An attachment bond for less penalty than the debt is insufficient. JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is an attachment issued by a justice of the peace, and returned to the circuit court under the act of assembly allowing such ex parte proceedings. An attachment bond taken in a less penalty than the debt, is void, and the process must be quashed. We have not thought it necessary to notice the errors assigned in detail. Suffice it to say, that the bond returned contains a far less penalty than the debt demanded and recovered by the attachment. This, according to former decisions of this court, and the express provisions of the act of assembly, must be held fatal. The judgment of the court below must therefore be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded, with directions to quash the attachment with costs. Ky.App. 1821. Samuel v.
