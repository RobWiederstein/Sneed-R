OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. The plaintiff below obtained a judgment in debt, by petition and summons against Hardin Gray and William Conner. Gray departed this life, and plaintiff in the judgment issued a scire facias to revive the judgment against both the administrators of Gray and Conner, the surviving defendant. The defendants in the scire facias demurred, and the court gave judgment against them, to reverse which this writ of error is prosecuted. Demurrer to the scire facias, and judgment for plaintiff. The only question made by the assignment of error, and presented to our consideration is, that there was a misjoinder of parties; that the personal representatives of the deceased defendant could not be joined with the survivor, for the purpose of reviving the judgment; and to support this position the case of Johnson's heirs v. Deason, 3 Bibb, 260, and 1 Chit. plead. 37, is cited and relied on. Case of  Johnson's heirs v. Deason, 3 Bibb, 260-1; overruled. It is true that in the case of Johnson's heirs v. Deason, a scire facias against the representatives of a deceased defendant, omitting the survivor in a joint judgment, was sustained. But more recent decisions have made the survivor a necessary party, and have declared a scire facias invalid without them; see Mitchell's heirs v. Smith's heirs, 1 Litt. Rep. 243; Holder's heirs v. Commonwealth, 3 Marsh. 410. In a scire facias to revive a judgment against the representatives of a deceased defendant, the surviving defendant must be made a party. The reason assigned why the representatives of one joint defendant can not be united with the survivor, is, that the judgment must be against one in their representative character, and also against the other in his own right. This difficulty is, however, easily obviated by the doctrine that a joint scire facias does not require necessarily, a joint judgment, but the judgment that the plaintiff have execution may be several, against each, and ought to be so, where one is liable individually and the other in a representative character, Such a judgment has been rendered in the present instance, and there is, therefore, no error therein and it is consequently, affirmed with costs. *2 Judgment in such case ought to be several. Crittenden, for plaintiff; Wickliffe, for defendant. Ky.App. 1827. Gray's Adm'r v. McDowell 5 T.B.Mon. 501, 21 Ky. 501, 1827 WL 1595 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
