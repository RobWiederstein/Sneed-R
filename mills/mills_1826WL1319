OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE MILLS. Statement. The plaintiff in the court below, now appellee, declared against the defendants, now appellants, in an action of covenant, on a writing in the following words: "For value received, I promise to pay John Lewis fifty pounds worth of horses, to be valued by William White and Harman Nash, at their value as trading for land, to be paid on or before the first day of November, one thousand eight hundred and eleven. Witness my hand and seal, this thirty-first day of October, 1809. Obligation declared upon. (Signed)                                  GEORGE BOHANNON, (Seal.) JULIUS BOHANNON." The breach assigned was the non payment of the horses. The declaration in setting out the instrument did it thus: "The said defendants by their certain covenant in writing signed with their proper names, and sealed with the seal of the defendant George, and which is now to the court here shewn, &c." Instrument set out in the count. *2 Te defendants craved oyer and demurred, in which the defendant joined, and the demurrer was sustained. Oyer and demurrer, sustained. The plaintiff then obtained leave to amend his declaration, and did so, by striking out the words "seal of the defendant George," and inserting in lieu thereof, "seal of the defendants." Amendment. The defendants still retained their oyer and again demurred to the declaration, which the court then overruled; and the correctness of this last decision is first presented to us. Demurrer and judgment for plaintiff. This writing having been executed previous to the act of assembly which has raised unsealed writings, to the dignity of sealed instruments, can not be affected by any of its provisions, but must be tested by the law as it stood before the passage of the act. It is very evident, that the first decision of the court was correct. For the plaintiff having declared in covenant against both, and stated the deed to be sealed by one only, could not sustain his action jointly. As to one, it was a covenant, and as to the other, a simple contract, and as the seal is essential to support covenant, and the defendant liable on simple contract, could not be joined in covenant, it is clear the action could not be supported. Declaration in covenant against two on a writing made prior to the act of 1812, raising the dignity of unsealed writings, stating the deed to be sealed by one only, is ill on oyer and demurrer. But as the plaintiff amended his declaration, and stated it to be sealed by both, his attitude was made far better. If the writing was not sealed in fact by both, it is evident that his action thereon could not be aided by this statement, which sets out the writing not according to the truth. The only question, then, which can arise in favor of the plaintiff on this last demurrer is, could the court on oyer and demurrer, see that the instrument was not sealed by both, or was a plea necessary to contest the fact of its being sealed by both? or in other words, must the instrument declared on as sealed appear upon oyer to have a seal at both signatures, to enable the plaintiff to recover. Formerly seals were made by wax; only; but an act of assembly of this state has made a scrawl affixed, in lieu of a seal, equal to a seal, or to the same effect. When wax was the only seal employed, any number of parties might use the same seal. Shepherd, in his Touchstone, page 55, says if there be twenty to seal one deed, and they all seal upon one piece of wax and with one seal yet if they make distinct and several prints, this is a sufficient sealing and the deed is good. Modern authorities have still gone farther, and decided that one may seal for the rest with their consent; and the deed be as binding as if every one had put his several seal--and one may execute for the others in his presence, and affix but one seal; Phil. Ev. 416; if then one seal on wax would be good for so many, and two ore more might affix but one seal, it follows that the same may happen with a scrawl, and when an instrument with one seal and two or more signers, is alleged to be sealed by all, the court on demurrer is not authorized to infer from there being but one seal and two or more signers, that but one in fact sealed the instrument; and the party who contends that it is not his seal, must reach the fact by way of plea, controverting the allegation--and as one seal may be the seal of many signers, the court from the bare inspection of the paper and declaration, can not decide that it is the seal of one only. *3 One seal and now one scrawl may be sufficient for several signers, and the count on such an instrument is good in the usual form.--For on oyer and demurrer, the court can not say all did not unite in adopting or fixing the seal on scrawl. The defendants, when they demurred to the declaration, filed also four special pleas, to all of which the plaintiff demurred by one joint demurrer, and the court sustained the demurrer and awarded an inquiry of damages, and upon the finding of the jury gave judgment for the plaintiff. Special pleas, demurrer to all, and judgment for plaintiff. As the deumrrer to all these pleas is a joint one, if any one of them is good, the demurrer ought to have been overruled. This imposes upon us the necessity of examining the merits of each of these pleas. On a joint demurrer to several pleas, if either be good the demurrer must be overruled. Most of them in substance allege that on the day the demand became due, one of the defendants was ready at his usual place of residence, where he resided when the deed was executed, with horses of the value named in the deed, and then and there, at the uttermost convenient hour of the day, tendered them to the plaintiff, who did not attend to receive them. The first of these pleas we deem invalid, because it does not allege that he had horses there of the value called for in the writing, according to the valuation of William White and Harman Nash. As the defendant was the agent who was to perform, he had to do all that could be done, without the concurrence of the plaintiff, and as the valuers were named it was his duty to procure their attendance, and he was to tender horses not of the general value of fifty pounds, but horses of that value in the opinion of those valuers. Plea of tender to a covenant to pay 501 worth of horses, to be valued by W. and N. must shew, that the defendant procured W. and N. to attend, and that the horses were of the 501 value in their opinion. The third plea is also bad, for it alleges that the plaintiff did not procure the attendance of these valuers; as it was not his duty, but belonged to his adversary to procure them, the plea evidently shews that the defendant did not do all that he was bound to do. It is the duty of obligor in such case to procure the valuers. The fourth does not allege a tender, but that the defendant was there ready with the horses of the requisite value, but was prevented from tendering or discharging the covenant, because neither the valuers nor the plaintiff attended. As the valuers were to be procured by the defendants, and no reason is shewn why they were not procured, the plea is evidently bad. Plea of readiness without a tender in such case insufficient. On the second plea there is more difficulty. It is to this effect: "That on the first day of November, 1811, he was ready at his own residence, where he resided at the time of executing and delivering the contract, and of which the plaintiff had notice, with horses of the value of fifty pounds as trading for land, and then and there offered and tendered the same to plaintiff at the uttermost convenient time of the day in discharge of his said covenant, and that he the said defendant by the death of Harman Nash, was prevented from procuring his attendance to value said horses, and the plaintiff, or any one for him did not attend to appoint other valuers, or to receive the same." *4 Plea of tender but that the property could not be valued by the persons in the covenant named, because one of them had died--held to be insufficient. This plea alleges that the defendant did all that he could do to discharge his contract, and that he was prevented from obtaining the valuers named, and it involves the question whether he could thus discharge his covenant, after the death of one of the valuers. After the most mature consideration, we have concluded that he could not. This is an express stipulation. Covenants implied, and covenants in law, may be discharged by act of God; but express stipulations seldom can. Covenants implied, and in law may be discharged by act of God, but express covenants seldom can. A lessee who has expressly covenanted to repair, is bound to do so, though the premises are destroyed by lightning; because it was his folly to stipulate against such inevitable events, and he is supposed to have covenanted against them, and to run the risk of their transpiring. It is then not more severe, to say that the defendants in this case, having stipulated expressly to pay property, according to the estimation of these men, must and did run the risk of procuring such valuation to be made, and being prevented from doing so, they are not discharged from rendering a compensation in damages, for a breach of their express stipulation. Lessee covenanting to repair, must rebuild what is destroyed by lightning. The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed with costs and damages. Barry, for appellants; Mayes, for defendant. Ky.App. 1826.
