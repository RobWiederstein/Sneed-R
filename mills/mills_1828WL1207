The plaintiff in error brought her petion and summons, on a note executed to her intestate, in the following words: "On or before the 10th of May next, I promise to pay John V. Bush, one hundred and fifty round silver dollars, for value received, this 19th day of March, 1817. (Signed,)                                 WILLIAM T. BUSH. Teste, WILL. T. CHRISTIE. I will pay fifteen per cent. on the above note until paid. (Signed,)                                 WILLIAM T. BUSH. The defendant craved oyer and demurred--the plaintiff joined in demurrer, and the court gave judgment on the demurrer for the defendant, and the plaintiff has prosecuted her writ of error. It does not necessarily follow that a promissory note, with an agreement underwritten by payor to "pay fifteen per cent. on the above till paid" was given for an usurious loan. --Hence a demurrer to a declaration on such an instrument with the underwriting taken as part thereof, will not avail. We conceive the court below erred. For although this note was given, when the act of assembly, then in force, declared all usurious contracts void, yet there is no way on the face of the instrument, of arriving at the conclusion that the contract is usurious, even if we admit the memorandum at the bottom to be part of the note, and as constituting part of the demand for which the plaintiff craves judgment in her petition. The question of borrowing or lending, or a promise of extraordinary interest for forbearance, is that on which the question of usury rests, and there is nothing on the face of the writing which proves that the fifteen per cent. was promised, in consideration of forbearance, or for some other consideration, and if it was based on any other legal consideration, the stipulation was valid. It was, therefore, by plea to fact alone, that the defendant could avail himself of the usury, if it exists. The usury must be pleaded. Judgment reversed, with costs, and cause remanded, with directions to enter judgment for plaintiff, unless the defendant shall apply for, and obtain leave to withdraw the demurrer and plead to the merits of the action. Wickliffe and Hanson, for plaintiff; Crittenden, for defendant. Ky.App. 1828. Bush's Adm'x v. Bush 7 T.B.Mon. 53, 23 Ky. 53, 1828 WL 1207 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
