JUDGE MILLS DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The appellant filed his bill in the court below, alleging that Edmund Logwood was the patentee of a tract of land to the one half of which Robert Johnson was entitled as locator, and that Johnson executed to him an instrument of writing in the following words: "I am willing to let John W. Howe have four hundred acres of land in Logwood's 10,000 acre entry, near Ohio and Little Sandy, where he has settled on the tract from Major Hood's to the salt works, at its value, if we cannot agree when it is laid off as woodland, provided Logwood, my patentee, will agree to it; but if good salt water should be found on it, then we are to pay for his improvements and give him other land at its value, and keep the land. Given under our hands and seals this 2d day of September, 1802. Signed                                    ROBERT JOHNSON, (Seal.) JOHN W. HOWE, (Seal.)" He then proceeds to allege that in the month of November, 1811, Thomas Logwood, a son of the patentee, and claiming as his heir after his decease, came to this state, and by commissioners procured a division of the land between himself and Johnson, in which division the appellant's settlement fell into the share assigned to Logwood;--and that after an unsuccessful negotiation about the purchase of the land from Thomas Logwood, he, Logwood, insisted that Howe should surrender the possession; that he, the appellant, was unwilling to do it, unless Logwood would pay for the improvements; that Logwood professed a willingness to pay for the improvements and promised to do so if he, Howe, would take a lease for the premises for one year, and execute his note for the rent, which he did do, being perplexed with his situation and so confused that he hardly knew what he did; that he had made large, lasting and valuable improvements on the land, of great value, relying on the faith of the contract with Johnson--and that at the end of the year Logwood had sued for the rent, and prosecuted a warrant of forcible detainer to judgment. He then makes Thomas Logwood and Johnson's heirs defendants, and prays compensation for his improvements. *2 Logwood answers, admitting he found the appellant on the land--that he had offered to let the appellant have it, but the terms did not suit him proposed by the appellant, and that he threatened suit for the possession till the appellant took the lease; and he utterly denies that he ever professed any willingness to pay for the improvements, or promised to do so. Johnson's heir admit the writing of their ancestor, but contest their liability for improvements. The circuit court dismissed the bill; from which decree Howe has appealed to this court?? There is but one witness who proves any promise or assurance on the part of Logwood to pay for the improvements; and no corroborating circumstance aids this proof. According to a well settled rule the positive denial of the answer must prevail over this evidence. It is not pretended that Edmund Logwood, the patentee, ever agreed to the sale or contract, if so it may be called between Johnson and Howe. As the improvements are assigned to Logwood, and are enjoyed by him, there can be no ground for a decree against Johnson's heirs unless the expressions of the writing should bind them to pay for the value of the improvements. It is evident from an inspection of the writing that the stipulation to pay for improvements could only operate on the contingency of the patentees agreeing to the sale of the land, and that sale being completed-- of salt water then being found, on which event it was to revert to the vendors. In other words, if the contract was ever completed, and under the faith of it, Howe should make improvements, and salt water should be found, on which event he must give it up, then his improvements must be taken into account on the rescission of the contract, and their value paid. These contingencies not having happened, the stipulation relative to improvements cannot have any bearing in favor of the appellant against Johnson's heirs. An imperfect contract for lands, dependent for its completion on contingencies which never happen, does not entitle the occupant to compensation for improvements; he must be considered as a tenant at will, the improvements made for his own accommodation, and must surrender on the demand of the owner. The question remaining is, was the appellant such an occupant as was innocently induced to expend his labor in ameliorations, which ought to be compensated by Logwood, to whom they are assigned. We cannot denominate the writing relied upon a contract for the sale of the land, It fixed only the quantity, and not the price of the land. This rested upon the future and uncertain agreement of the parties; and if they could not agree, the value, ascertained in some other mode, was to be resorted to. The writing was to have no operation without the consent of the patentee, which the appellant might thereafter obtain if he could, and which he never attempted to obtain. In short the writing was only a declaration of a willingness to make a sale, on certain contingencies which never happened. The appellant might have, for a short period a reasonable hope that he would be able to obtain a contract, but he never could have a reasonable belief that the land was his or suppose it his own. He appears, by the writing to be settled first upon the land having no claim. He attempted to procure it, but never brought his negotiation to a close. If he never bought he confessedly had no interest. If, under these circumstances, he expended his money and labor on improvements, he must be presumed to have done so for his temporary convenience and could not expect the paramount enjoyment. To surrender them to the right owner, he must stand always ready; and a tenant at will might as reasonably expect a remuneration for improvements, which he must surrender at the will of his landlord. We conceive, therefore, that the court did right in deciding against his claim. *3 The decree must be affirmed with costs. Pope for appellees, Bibb for appellant. Ky.App. 1821. Howe v.
