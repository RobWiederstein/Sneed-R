Nature and Extent of Authority in General. Most Cited Cases It is the duty of the sheriff to write the delivery bond when the sureties are tendered. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. It is the opinion of the court that when property is taken by a sheriff under an execution, and the defendant is desirous to retain the possession of it, and offers security for its forthcoming at the day of sale, that it is not incumbent upon the defendant to write the bond, but that it is the duty of the sheriff to do so. The sheriff has the execution in his possession, to which the bond should be made in some degree to conform; he is allowed a fee for taking the bond, is bound to take a valid one, and must fix the day of sale. When security for the delivery of the property is therefore tendered to him, it is peculiarly and emphatically his duty to write the bond and present it to the defendant, for his and his surety's signature and delivery. It is the duty of the sheriff to write the delivery bond when the sureties are tendered, and not of the defendant. The court below, therefore, erred in deciding that it was not the duty of the sheriff, but that of the defendant, whose property was taken in execution, to write the bond for the forthcoming of the property, at the day of sale. The judgment must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded to that court, and further proceedings had, not inconsistent with this opinion. Triplett, for plaintiff. Ky.App. 1827. Price v.
