Most Cited Cases A motion against the securities of a sheriff, for money collected and not paid over, must be joint against all. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. Statement of the case. This writ of error is brought to reverse a judgment rendered against Sutton, as one of the sureties of Collins, late sheriff of Allen county, upon a motion for the failure of Collins to pay over money collected by him on executions which issued in favor of Stark. There is one objection to the proceedings in the court below, which must be held fatal to the judgment rendered in favor of Stark. The objection to which we allude, is that the motion was made against one only, of several sureties of the sheriff, Collins, in his official bond. Prior to the 31st of January, 1811, there was no law authorizing any person whose money was collected ??y a sheriff, under execution, to recover the amount of ??he sureties of the sheriff, by motion; and by the act of ??hat date, the motion is given against the sureties joint??y, and not against part only. See 2 Dig. L. K. 1146. Motion against the securities of a sheriff, for money collected and not paid over, must be joint against all, not against part only. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed with ??osts, the cause remanded to the court below, and the motion dismissed for costs. Monroe, for plaintiff; Sharp, attorney general, for defendant.
