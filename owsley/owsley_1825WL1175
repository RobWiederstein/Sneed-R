ERROR TO THE BATH COUNTY COURT. West Headnotes Labor and Employment 231H k 925 231H Labor and Employment 231HX Apprentices 231Hk925 k. In General. Most Cited Cases (Formerly 255k9.1  Master and Servant, 32k10  Apprentices) The proceedings for the release of an apprentice must be in his name, and not in that of his father. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. It was irregular for the county court, upon the motion of M'Gowen, without his son being a party, to make an order releasing his son from his apprenticeship to M'Daniel. The act of assembly of this country gives jurisdiction in such cases to the county court, but requires the application to be made by the apprentice.FNa1 It is not intended to say that a father can not, on behalf of his infant son, prosecute such a proceeding, but it is designed to say, that if he does so, the proceedings must be carried on in the name of the apprentice and not in the name of the father. FNa1. 2 Dig. L. K. Title, Master and Apprentice, 881, 1 Littell's L. K., 677. The proceeding in the county court for the release of an apprentice must be in his name, not his father's. The order of the county court must, therefore, be reversed with cost. Triplett, for plaintiff in error. Ky.App. 1825. McDaniel v. McGowen 3 T.B.Mon. 9, 19 Ky. 9, 1825 WL 1175 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
