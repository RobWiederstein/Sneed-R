Legal Relief in General. Most Cited  Cases Where a court of equity has obtained jurisdiction of a cause for the purpose of discovery, and the subject-matter is proper for the consideration of a court of equity, it will dispose of the case finally, although the remedy at law is fully adequate had not a discovery been necessary. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This writ of error is brought to reverse a decree of the court below, pronounced in favor of Green for $3,600, upon a bill exhibited by him in that court against Jenkins. According to the allegations of the bill, Green being the proprietor of a quantity of merchandise, placed them in the care of Jenkins, in trust, to sell for the use and benefit of Green; but Jenkins having fraudulently asserted a property in the goods, and sold part thereof, and being about to remove the balance from the state, this suit was brought, as well for the purpose of obtaining a discovery of the amount, as for relief. A chancellor receiving jurisdiction for the purposes of discovery, should retain it for the purpose of relief: vide  8 Ky. 24, Handly v. Fitzhugh, ac.--and post Lynch v. Sumrall. If it were proper to grant relief to any extent, there is no doubt but the court properly gave a decree for the value of the goods admitted by the answer of Jenkins. And that the case demanded relief, we apprehend there is no just reason to doubt. It was certainly correct to take cognizance of the case, for the purpose of a discovery, and having obtained it, we suppose the court properly inquired into the fraudulent abuse of the trust, and gave relief commensurate to the injury. The decree must, therefore, be affirmed with cost. Ky.App. 1819. Jenkins v. Green 1 A.K.Marsh. 463, 8 Ky. 463, 1819 WL 1044 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
