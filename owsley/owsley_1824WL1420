Most Cited Cases It is proper, in dismissing a bill, not to award damages on a judgment at law, when the order enjoining the judgment was signed by only two justices;  the act then in force requiring the concurrence of three justices. TRIPLETT and WICKLIFFE for plaintiff; CRITTENDEN and HAGGIN for defendant. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. In pronouncing the decree dismissing Owings' bill, the court was perfectly correct in not awarding damages upon the judgment at law. Damages on the dissolution of an injunction, can not be given, unless the injunction is regularly awarded. The order which was obtained by Owings from two justices of the peace, gave no authority to the clerk to issue an injunction against the judgment at law; nor did the certificate endorsed upon the subpoena in chancery by the clerk, amount to an injunction. The certificate of the clerk barely goes to show that an order had been received from two justices of the peace, directing him to issue an injunction, upon bond and security being given, and that the bond was accordingly given. The clerk certifying on the subpoena, that an order had been received from two justices, directing him to issue an injunction, upon bond and security being given which was done, does not amount to an injunction. The order from the two justices, bears date in 1819, at which time, two justices possessed no authority to grant injunctions. The act of assembly then in force, required the concurrence of three justices. The objection taken to the refusal of the court to award damages, can not, therefore, be sustained. The decree must be affirmed with costs. Ky.App. 1824. Wilkins v. Owings 5 Litt. 239, 15 Ky. 239, 1824 WL 1420 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
