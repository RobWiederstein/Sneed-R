Most Cited Cases Defendant in ejectment, to prove adverse possession for upwards of 20 years, need show no written evidence of title to bar plaintiff. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: *1 The appellants, who were defendants in the circuit court, having proved in themselves and those under whom they claim, an adverse possession for upwards of twenty years, it was irregular to instruct the jury, that they could not avail themselves of the length of possession, unless they produced some written evidence of the right and transfer of those under whom the claimed. A defendant in ejectment having had twenty years' possession, need shew no written evidence of the title to bar a plaintiff--Vide ante, Taylor v. Buckner, acc. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. Ky.App. 1819. Herndon v.
