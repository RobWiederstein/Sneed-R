Most Cited Cases A breach of one independent covenant cannot cannot be pleaded in bar to an action brought for the breach of another, though they were the consideration for each other. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: According to the case of Sanders against  Beall's adm'r, 4 Bibb, 342, the circuit court decided correctly in sustaining Hanna's demurrer to Winebrinner's plea, alleging a failure to perform a covenant contained in a different instrument to that upon which this action was brought, although the covenant set up in the plea formed the consideration of the note upon which Hanna's action is founded. A breach of one independent covenant can not be plead in bar to an action brought for the breach of another, though they were the considerations of each other. The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed with cost and damages. Talbot for appellant, Bibb for appellee. Ky.App. 1820. Winebrinner v. Hanna 2 A.K.Marsh. 357, 9 Ky. 357, 1820 WL 1053 (Ky.)
