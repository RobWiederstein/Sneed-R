Most Cited Cases (Formerly 188k57) A declaration under the act of 1799, claiming the money bet as well for plaintiff as for the commonwealth, is faulty. It should claim "as well for plaintiff as in aid of the county levy." JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: *1 The first question proper to be decided in this case, involves the propriety of bringing an action of debt to recover property lost at games of cards. The act of 1798 allowing any person to recover money, &c., betted to his own use, is superceded by the act of 1799, which directs the suit to be qui tam. But as the act of 1799 does not prescribe the form of action, while that of 1798 prescribes "debt," that is yet the proper action. A declaration under the act of 1799 claiming the recovery as well for the plaintiff as for the commonwealth, is faulty; it should claim "as well for plaintiff as in aid of the county levy. A plaintiff qui tam whose writ is in debt for money, must not declare for property. Testing this question by the act of 1798 (1 Lit. 104,) only, there could be no possible difficulty in sustaining the action; and although by the act of 1799 (1 Lit. 284) the property betted is declared to be forfeited, and allowed to be recovered for the use of the county and the person suing only, as there is a clear repugnance between such a recovery and that given exclusively to the person suing by the act of 1798, the latter act, so far as there is an incompatibility must be construed to be a repeal of the former; yet as by the latter act, no mode of actions is expressly required, and as the property may, in those cases where by the former act, debt was the proper action, be still recovered as well for the use of the county as the person suing, as respects the form of action, there exists no repugnance between the two acts, and consequently debt, as it was given by the former, may now be brought under the latter. But as by the latter act, one moiety of the property recovered is expressly required to be applied in aid of the county levy, the declaration should no doubt claim a recovery as well for the use of the county as the person suing; and consequently, as the declaration in the present case demanded a recovery, not in aid of the county levy, but for the commonwealth, the court below ought to have sustained the demurrer to the declaration. For that cause, therefore, the judgment must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and the plaintiff in that court, if he should apply to do so, have leave to amend his declaration; but as the writ in debt for money, he should not be allowed to declare for property.
