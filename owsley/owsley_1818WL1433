JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT:FNa1 FNa1. Absent Judge Logan. This was an action on a contract for the conveyance of a piece of land. Judgment was taken by default, and on the execution of a writ of inquiry, the circuit court decided that the jury had a right to presume fraud from the failure of the defendant to perform his contract, unless he destroyed the presumption by other proof, and he having produced no such proof, the court instructed the jury, that the value of the land, at the time of the inquest, together with the value of the improvements on the land at the time of the contract, formed the proper criterion of damages. A defendant covenanting to convey lands, and failing to do so, the measure of damages is the value of the land at the time of the sale, to be ascertained by the price given, or other evidence. It has been settled by a current of decisions in this court that where one contracts to convey land, and is without fraud, unable to make a title, the measure of damages, to which the vendee is entitled, is the value of the land at the time of the sale, to be ascertained by the consideration fixed, or other evidence. Where the inability of the vendor has been produced by fraud on his part, a different rule has prevailed; but a failure to convey has never been adjudged to be evidence of a fraudulent inability, and we think ought not to be so adjudged. For an inability to convey may, and frequently does, happen without fraud, and fraud is odious in law, and ought never to be presumed. Where the failure to convey has been produced by the fraud of the vendor, a different rule prevails.  2 Bibb, 543, Gerault v. Anderson. Fraud will not be presumed, it must be proved. The judgment must be reversed with costs, and the cause be remanded, that a writ of inquiry de novo may be awarded, &c. Pope, for appellant. Ky.App. 1818. Rutledge v.
