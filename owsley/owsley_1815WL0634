Apr. 13, 1815. *1 At common law, a corporation can only contract under the seal of the corporation. A suit against a corporation is not supported by a writing signed by the president alone, he having no power given by statute to bind the corporation. A petition and summons against a corporation, served on the president cannot authorize a judgment against the president individually.

Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. THIS was an action by petition and summons, brought by the defendants in error in the Court below, on the following writing, viz: "Madison Hemp Mill, 3d September, 1810--Due Captain Christopher Irvine one hundred and sixty-five dollars 75 cents, for 27 cwt. 2 19 hemp delivered by him at the factory. W. Macbean, president of the Madison Hemp and Flax spinning company." The petition was drawn against the corporation, and the summons issued against Macbean, the president of the company. Macbean appeared and filed a demurrer to the petition, which being joined by the plaintiff in that Court, was overruled by the Court and judgment rendered for the amount of the note. To reverse this judgment Macbean has prosecuted this writ of error with supersedeas. Owing to the great irregularity in the proceedings, we have had considerable difficulty in ascertaining against whom the judgment of the Court below is entered. We are, however, inclined to think it a judgment against Macbean, and has been so properly treated by him in prosecuting this writ of error. Whether, however, it be considered as against him or the corporation, in either point of view we are of opinion it is erroneous and must be reversed. If it be a judgment against Macbean, it is erroneous, for it is clear as the petition is against the corporation, it cannot authorize a process or judgment against Macbean; and if it be a judgment against the corporation, it is equally erroneous; for by no principle of law can the corporation be made liable under the writing which forms the basis of the action. *2 The corporation certainly cannot be liable, according to the principles of the common law; for by those principles it could not otherwise contract but under the seal of the corporation; and its liability cannot be created under the statute, for whatever power may be considered as having vested by the statute in the president and directors conjointly, it is plain no power is thereby given to the president alone, to bind the corporation by his contracts. The judgment must therefore be reversed with costs. Ky.App. 1815. Macbean v. Irvine's Ex'r 4 Bibb 17, 7 Ky. 17, 1815 WL 634 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
