In General. Most Cited  Cases A deed purported to have been sealed and delivered in June, 1789, and was proved before the general court at Richmond, Va., in November, 1805, by two of the subscribing witnesses, and on the certificate of that proof, and the oath of the other subscribing witness, was admitted to record by the clerk of a county court of Kentucky in October, 1815. Held, that a deed thus proved and recorded was clearly invalid as to creditors and purchasers, according to the laws of this country, and, as the authority conferred on clerks to take the proof and admit to record deeds of conveyance is given for the benefit of creditors, unless the proof is taken and the deed lodged to be recorded, so as to be valid against purchasers and creditors, the clerk cannot per se authorize a copy from his office to be used as evidence of its due execution, and hence it was error to admit a copy of such deed as evidence. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This case turns upon the correctness of the decision of the court below, in admitting as evidence, a copy of a deed, taken from the records of the county court of Mason. The deed purports to have been sealed and delivered in June, 1789, and proved before the general court at Richmond, Virginia, in November, 1805, by two of the subscribing witnesses, and upon the certificate of that proof, and the oath of the other subscribing witness, was admitted to record by the clerk of the Mason county court, in October, 1815. A deed proved by two w??es in a sister state, and by one before the clerk of the county court where the lands lie, is not sufficient proof of the execution of the deed. A copy of a deed thus proved is not evidence. To render such copy evidence, the proof of the deed must be such as would render it valid against creditors and purchasers. The deed, thus proven and recorded, is clearly, according to the laws of this country, invalid as to creditors and purchasers, and as the authority, conferred upon clerks to take the proof and admit to record deeds of conveyance, is given for the benefit of creditors, we are of opinion that, unless the proof is taken, and the deed lodged to be recorded, so as to be valid against purchasers and creditors, the certificate of the clerk can not per se authorize a copy from his office to be used as evidence of the due execution of the deed. *2 Because, therefore, the copy was admitted as evidence, the judgment must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
