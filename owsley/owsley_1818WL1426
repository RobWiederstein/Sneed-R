Defenses. Most Cited  Cases Where a judgment at law has been obtained against an administrator who has failed and is unable to pay, the plaintiff has not thereby forfeited his right to relief in equity against the heirs. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This case, in principle, is not otherwise, on its merits, distinguishable from that of Couchman's heirs against O'Bannon, just decided, than by the latter case no action was ever prosecuted at law, but by this case it appears an action at law has been prosecuted and judgment obtained against the administrator of Couchman, but without having obtained satisfaction. But if we are correct in the supposition, that that case is one properly cognizable in equity, the circumstance of a judgment having been obtained at law in this, should not preclude the giving relief. A party entitled to relief in equity, will not forfeit that right by having made an unproductive attempt at law. The administrator, it is true, must be, as he correctly has been made, a party to the suit in chancery, but as he has not only failed, but alleges an inability, to pay the judgment, upon no principle of equity can the circumstance of the judgment having been obtained against him, preclude the chancellor from extending that relief, which would have been otherwise proper. The decree must be affirmed with cost and damages. Wickliffe, for appellant; B. Hardin, contra. Ky.App. 1818. Couchman's Heirs v. Slaughter 1 A.K.Marsh. 388, 8 Ky. 388, 1818 WL 1426 (Ky.)
