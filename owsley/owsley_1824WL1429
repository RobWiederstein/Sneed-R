Most Cited  Cases An execution issued on a replevin bond, which has been assigned, should be sued out in the name of the obligee in the bond;  and hence a delivery bond on an execution issued on an assigned replevin bond should be made payable to the assignor. HOPKINS, HAGGIN and HUSTON for appellant; TALBOT and SHARP for appellee. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. Although the replevin bond, which was taken to Lazarus Powell, may have been assigned by him, it was correct to issue the execution thereon in his name; but it was irregular for the sheriff to take the bond for the delivery of the property seized under the execution, to Henderson Powell, though by an endorsement of the clerk upon the execution, he appears to be the assignee of the replevin bond, and beneficially interested in the execution. Although a replevin bond may be assigned to a third person, the execution thereon must still issue in the name of the obligee; and a delivery bond taken to the assignee, by virtue of said execution, is irregular. It was therefore correct, on the application of Lazarus Powell, not only to quash the bond taken by the sheriff for the delivery of the property on the day of sale, but to enable him to sue out another execution upon the replevin bond, it was also correct to quash the execution which had issued and was returned by the sheriff. The judgment must be affirmed with costs. Ky.App. 1824. Jones v. Powell 5 Litt. 289, 15 Ky. 289, 1824 WL 1429 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
