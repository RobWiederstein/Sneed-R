Most Cited  Cases In a joint action against two, on a joint note, it is error to give judgment against one, while the suit is depending against the other. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: *1 The action in this case being joint, and founded upon a joint undertaking, it was clearly irregular, after the service of process upon Buford and Pawling, and without the cause having been disposed of as to Pawling, to take judgment against Buford only. In a joint action against two on a joint undertaking, it is error to enter judgment against one while the cause is undisposed of against the other: Vide ante, page 59, Jouitt v. Simpson. The judgment must therefore be reversed with cost, the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Ky.App. 1818. Buford v.
