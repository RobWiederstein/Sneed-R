Most Cited Cases Where an insolvent debtor claims in his schedule a debt due to himself, the summons against the debtor should not be to answer any particular creditor of the insolvent. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This writ of error is brought to recover a judgment rendered against M'Coun, upon a summons issued from the clerk's office of Fayette, for M'Coun to answer and say whether he was indebted to Daniel Gibbs, an insolvent debtor, $346. The summons having been executed, and M'Coun failing to appear, after a continuance of one term, judgment was rendered against him by default, for the amount specified in the summons. An insolvent claiming in his schedule, a debt due to himself, the summons v. the debtor should not be to answer any particular creditor of the insolvent. The summons is rightfully directed to, and served by, the sheriff and the judgment (if any) should be in the name of the sheriff. The proceedings having been had under the act of this country concerning executions,  (1 Littell, 549), the clerk, no doubt, correctly issued the summons against M'Coun, without therein requiring him to answer the complaint of any particular creditor. And as the act nowhere requires a declaration to be filed, the court most clearly, upon the failure of M'Coun to appear and answer, correctly entered judgment against him for the amount contained in the summons. And although, as the act directs, judgment was entered in favor of the sheriff, yet as the sheriff is nowise personally interested in the claim against M'Coun, the summons was properly directed to, and served by him. The judgment must be affirmed with cost. Ky.App. 1818. McCoun v. Sheriff of Fayette 1 A.K.Marsh. 362, 8 Ky. 362, 1818 WL 1411 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
