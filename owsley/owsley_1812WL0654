THIS is an action of debt brought by Gohagin, as assignee of Henry Shrader, in the Hardin Circuit Court, on a bond executed in the State of Virginia, for L>>>>>469 14s. Maryland currency, equal to L375 15s. 2d. Kentucky currency. On the trial of the cause, the jury returned a verdict for L469 14s. Maryland currency, equal to L>>>>>375 15s. 2d. Kentucky currency, and one penny in damages, whereupon the Court awarded judgment against Davidson for L 469 14s. Maryland currency, equal to L375 15s. 2d. Kentucky currency, the debt in the declaration mentioned, with interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum from the 25th of June, 1802, until paid, and costs, etc. The only question which we deem necessary to be considered in this cause is, whether the Court acted correctly in awarding judgment for interest. The rate of interest of another State is matter of fact, and as all other facts should be found by the jury; it should have been found in damages. The jury having found but one penny damages, it was not competent for the Court to infer the fact different from the finding of the jury, and award judgment accordingly. It is, therefore, considered by the Court, that the judgment of the Hardin Circuit Court is erroneous, and must be reversed, the cause remanded to that Court for judgment to be awarded according to verdict without interest Ky.App. 1812.
