Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. THERE appears to have been one new trial granted in this case at the instance of Herndon, and after a second verdict was found against him, he again applied for a new trial, on the grounds of his having discovered, since the finding of the verdict, that one of the former jury composed part of the latter; but the Court refused his application; and the only question for the decision of this Court is as to the correctness of the opinion of that Court. There is no doubt but what the juror was incompetent, and might have been challenged before he was sworn; and as that cause of challenge was not known to the attorney of Herndon, until after the finding of the verdict, (Herndon himself not being present) according to the case of M'Kinley v. Smith, Hard. Rep. 167, and Pierce v. Bush, (vol. 3, 347) it furnished a good cause for a new trial. The Court, therefore, upon the affidavit of the attorney proving the discovery, should have awarded a new trial. The judgment must be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded to the Court below for a new trial. Ky.App. 1815. Herndon v. Bradshaw 4 Bibb 45, 7 Ky. 45, 1815 WL 652 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
