Most Cited  Cases The owner of an entry residing out of the county where the land lies must appoint an agent and notify the surveyor before January 1, 1796, or the entry becomes forfeited. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT:FNa1 FNa1. Absent, Judge Rowan. Taylor, the owner of the entry under which the appelpellee claims, not having resided in the county of Bourbon, where the land lies, it was clearly necessary to have authorized the making his survey in 1805; that an agent resident in Bourbon county should have been appointed by him, and notice thereof given to the surveyor before the first of January, 1796, and consequently the subsequent appointment of an agent in 1797, can not have saved his entry from forfeiture. The owner of an entry, not living in the county where the land lies, must appoint an agent and notify the surveyor before January, 1796, or the land is forfeited. The decree of the court below, therefore, sustaining the appellee's claim under an entry thus illegally surveyed, must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and the bill dismissed with cost.
