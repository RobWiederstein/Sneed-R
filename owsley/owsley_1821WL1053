Survivorship. Most Cited  Cases Where a writing admits a certain sum as due to two persons named, an action can be brought thereon on the death of one of such persons by the survivor. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This writ of error, with supersedeas, is brought by M'Calla to reverse a judgment recovered against him on the following writ: The Building Committee of Fayette      Dr. Hospital, To Messrs. Briggs & Rigg, For amount of two bills of scantling      $1,098 10 delivered Suprr. Cr. 1818, January 12, by cash             800 00 Balance  due                        $298 10 In behalf of said committee, as their chairman, I acknowledge the above balance of $298 10 to be due said Briggs and Rigg. AND. M'CALLA, (chr. com.) The action was brought by petition in the circuit court, in the name of Rigg as survivor, and the judgment obtained against M'Calla by default. Two questions are made by the assignment of errors--1st, as to the propriety of bringing a petition and summons in the name of Rigg only as the surviving obligee; and 2d, as to the liability of M'Calla under the writing on which the action is brought. This court entertains no doubt, but the action in the name of the survivor may be sustained. It has heretofore been decided by this court, that a petition may be maintained by an executor, on an obligation given to his testator; and the reason is equally strong in favor of a surviving obligee. A petition and summons may be maintained in favor of a surviving obligee. We are also of opinion, that the writing imports a personal liability on M'Calla. It would not have done so, if he were not one of the building committee; and from his signature he must be understood to be one of the committee, and under his acknowledgement of the committee being indebted, we apprehend he must be chargeable. The chairman of a building committee, acknowledging a debt due by the committee, is personally liable. The judgment must be affirmed with costs and damages.
