Lawless, 1 Bibb, 496, and the same v. the same,  4  Bibb, 309, are decisive against the order of the county court establishing the ferry in this case. In each of those cases, it was decided to be necessary, that the record should show that the applicant for the ferry was owner of the land on one or both sides of the stream, or that notice, had been given, as required by the act of 1796. The record of this case shows neither of these facts. There is no suggestion of notice of the intended application having been given, nor is it stated on the record that the heirs of Ferguson, in whose favor the ferry was established, are the owners of the land on either side of the stream. The ferry was established across the Cumberland river, from opposite the lots of the heirs, No. 11 and 12, in the town of Smithland, to a point opposite said lots on the other side, but though opposite their lots, the river may nevertheless not bind on the lots at the point at which the ferry was established, and if it does not, it was of course, irregular to establish the ferry without notice to the proprietor of the land. Record establishing a ferry must shew the applicant owned the land on one or both sides the stream, or that notice had been given as required by the statute. The order must, consequently, be reversed with cost. Crittenden, for plaintiffs, Pope, for defendants. Ky.App. 1827. Givens v. Ferguson's Heirs 6 T.B.Mon. 186, 22 Ky. 186, 1827 WL 1666 (Ky.)
