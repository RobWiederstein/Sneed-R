(Cite as: 5 Litt. 338,  15 Ky. 338 (Ky.),  1824 WL 2290 (Ky.)) C Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Eubank v. Pence. Jun. 14, 1824. *1 FROM THE SHELBY COUNTY COURT. CRITTENDEN for Eubank; no attorney for Pence. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. The inquest of the jury, taken under the writ of ad quod damnum, which issued in this case, not having ascertained whether or not fish of passage will in any degree be obstructed, the court erred in ordering the mill seat to be condemned, and in giving permission to Pence to erect a mill. The inquest taken under a writ of ad quod damnum on a mill, should ascertain whether or not fish of passage would in any degree be obstructed?? The order must, therefore, be reversed with costs, the cause remanded to the court below, and the inquest of the jury quashed, and such further proceedings there had, as may not be inconsistent with this opinion.
