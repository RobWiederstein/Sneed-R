Jun. 15, 1818. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A DECISION OF THE WARREN CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Pretrial Procedure 307A k 717.1 307A Pretrial Procedure 307AIV Continuance 307Ak717 Absence of Witness or Evidence 307Ak717.1 k. In general. Most Cited Cases (Formerly 94k23  Continuance) A party cannot be injured by the refusal of a continuance asked to obtain immaterial evidence. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This case is not otherwise distinguishable from the case decided at this term between the same parties, than by an application which was made for a continuance in this case, which was not in that; but as we are unable to perceive the materiality of the facts designed to be proved by the absent witnesses, Grubbs can not have been injured by the refusal of the court below to continue the cause; and as, according to the case alluded to, the other points were correctly decided, the judgment rendered in this case, must be affirmed with cost. On an application for a continuance it is indispensible to shew the materiality of the absent witness. Hardin, for appellee. Ky.App. 1818. Grubbs v.
