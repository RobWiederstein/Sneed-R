Most Cited Cases (Formerly 233k290(1)) A person procuring possession of lands under a contract of purchase is no tenant, so as to subject him to a warrant of forcible detainer. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT:FNa1 FNa1. Absent Judge Logan. *1 The ancestor of the appellees having obtained the possion of the land in contest, under a contract with the ancestor of the appellants for a conveyance, we are of opinion, that in the sense intended by the act regulating proceedings for forcible detainers, he can not be said to have obtained the possession as tenant, so as to have either authorized the ancestor of the appellants in his lifetime, or his heirs since, in a proceeding under the act, to have obtained restitution on account of the failure of either of the appellees, or their ancestor, to surrender the possession. A person procuring possession of lands, under a contract of purchase, is no tenant so as to subject him to a warrant of forcible detainer. The judgment must be affirmed with cost. Ky.App. 1818.
