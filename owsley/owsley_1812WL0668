Most  Cited Cases A covenant may be declared on according to its operation in law, or set forth in haec verba, at the election of the party;  but, in a plea, the operation of the covenant or deed must be expressly averred. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. This is an action of covenant, brought by White, in the Jefferson circuit court, against the appellants. Verdict and judgment were obtained by White; to reverse which, this appeal is prosecuted. A covenant may be declared on according to its operation in law, or set forth in haec verba, at the election of the party. The only question which we deem necessary to notice, is, whether the writing upon which suit was brought should have been declared on according to its operation in law, and not in haec verba. That a covenant may be declared on, either in its words, or according to its operation in law, we have no doubt. A difference is said to exist between declarations and pleas; in the latter, the operation of the covnant or deed must be expressly averred. 1 Saund. 274, n. 1; Cro. Eliz. 195; Cro. Jac. 383. But in a plea, the operation of the covenant or deed must be expressly averred. The judgment of the circuit court must, therefore, be affirmed with costs and damages. Ky.App. 1812. Moore's Ex'rs v.
