JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The guardian appointed to defend for the infant, having neither answered or entered his appearance for the infant, it was irregular to proceed to a hearing of the cause, and take the bill for confessed. A guardian ad litem having neither appeared nor answered, it is irregular to take a bill as confessed against infants. Vide ante, Young v. Whitaker & al. The decree must, therefore, be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. M'Kinley, for appellants; Pope, contra. Ky.App. 1819. Carneal v.
