Most Cited Cases An entry calling for the line of another cannot be sustained, unless that line is shown. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is an appeal from a decree of the court below, dismissing the appellant's bill. The object of the bill is to compel the appellees to surrender the elder legal title, which they are admitted to have obtained for the land in contest, under an adverse claim, but to which the appellant asserts the superior equity under the following entry, viz:-- "1st April, 1784--William Bell enters 3,630 acres, being the residue of 11,000 beginning at the north-east corner of his entry of 15,000 acres; thence N, 45 E, 200 poles to Licking; thence down the meanders thereof, when reduced to a straight line, 1,640 poles; thence with David Tanner's line till it intersects with the line of his 15,000 acre entry, and along said line to the beginning." Assuming all the objects called for in this entry, except that of David Tanner's line, to be sufficiently identified and proven, still we should, from the settled course of adjudications in this court, be constrained to decide against the appellant's right to relief. An entry, calling for the line of another, can not be sustained, unless that line be shewn. Vide  8 Ky. 272, Debell v. Marshall, 272, acc. For as by being called for, the line of Tanner must, of necessity, give shape to the survey, it is impossible, in the absence of all evidence in relation to the situation of the line, (and in the present case there is a total absence of such evidence), for this court to say what portion of the land in contest, if any, is included within the limits of Bell's entry. Because, therefore, Tanner's line is not sufficiently identified, the court below decided correctly in dismissing the appellant's bill. The decree must consequently be affirmed with cost.
