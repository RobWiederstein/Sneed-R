JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is an appeal from a judgment rendered in favor of Purket, upon a verdict found for him on the trial of the general issue, in an action of ejectment brought by Shackelford. Shackelford claimed the land under a deed of bargain and sale executed to him by Purket, but for the purpose of shewing the deed was fraudulently and improperly obtained, Purket, on the trial, introduced one of the subscribing witnesses, and although objected to by Shackelford, was permitted not only to prove the deed was fraudulently obtained, but also to state what he had heard another subscribing witness say in relation to his attestation of the deed. A vendor in possession may protect himself in ejectment by shewing the deed under which the vendee claims, was fraudulently obtained, which may be done by the evidence of the subscribing witness. If the execution of the deed was fraudulently obtained, Shackelford, most clearly, ought not to succeed in recovering the possession of the land. The evidence, therefore, conducing to prove the fraud, was, no doubt, properly permitted to go to the jury; but what the witness had heard another say in relation to his attestation of the deed, as it was not the best evidence the nature of the case was susceptible of it ought not to have been admitted. Such evidence might be competent for the purpose of impeaching the credit of the person making the confessions, but as he was not introduced as a witness, it is plain the evidence could not have been introduced for that purpose, and as it was inadmissible for the purpose of proving the fraudulent execution of the deed, the judgment must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded to the court below, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. But the declaration of an absent subscribing witness is incompetent--such declarations are only admissible to impeach the credit of a witness. Pope for appellant. Ky.App. 1819. Shackelford v.
