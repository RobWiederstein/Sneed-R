Apr. 9, 1821. *1 ON A WRIT OF ERROR TO REVERSE A JUDGMENT OF THE FAYETTE CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Judgment 228 k 342(1) 228 Judgment 228IX Opening or Vacating 228k339 Authority of Court 228k342 After the Term 228k342(1) k. In General. Most Cited  Cases A court has no authority to vacate its judgment after the term at which it was rendered. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Kelly, having obtained judgment against Keizer in the circuit court, on an attachment under the law regulating proceedings against absconding debtors, Keizer, at a subsequent term, moved the court, and it accordingly, upon the introduction of extraneous evidence, set aside the judgment first rendered in favor of Kelly. A court possesses no power at a subsequent term to modify, set aside or alter, on motion, a judgment of a previous term, if such modification takes place it must be in the appellate court or by writ of error coram vobis. To reverse the decision, setting aside the first judgment this writ of error has been prosecuted by Kelly. This court is of opinion, the court possessed no power, at a subsequent term, to set aside the judgment first rendered. It is a settled principle that the power of courts over their judgments, cease with the term at which the judgment is given. If the judgment itself be erroneous, it can only be corrected by appeal or writ of error to this court; or, if the proceeding be irregular in a matter proper for a writ of error coram vobis, redress may be obtained in that mode, in the same court. But in neither case, is it competent for the court, on motion, to set aside a judgment rendered at a previous term. The judgment must be reversed with cost. Haggin for plaintiff. Ky.App. 1821.
