JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: According to the case of Jackson v. Jeffries, decided at the last term of this court, the court below incorrectly instructed the jury, that the lessors of the appellant who was plaintiff in that court, could not recover the land in contest, because of their having, since the commencement of the action, transferred their interest in the land, by the execution of a deed of conveyance to another person. The judgment of that court must, therefore be reversed, with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. The lessor of the plaintiff in ejectment selling the land lis pendens, does not abate the suit. Littell and Bibb for appellants, Pope for appellee. Ky.App. 1818. May v.
