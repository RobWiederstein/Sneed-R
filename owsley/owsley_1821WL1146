JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: *1 This was a traverse under the law regulating writs of forcible entries. The appellee sued, out from a justice of the peace, a warrant against the appellant for a forcible entry. A jury was summoned and an inquest found for the appellant. The inquest was traversed by the appellee, and issue being thereto joined, a jury was called in the circuit court. The jury returned a verdict for the appellee, and the court rendered judgment against the appellant for costs. From that judgment an appeal was granted to this court. We are of opinion the appeal was improvidently granted. If there had been judgment of restitution given, it might have been regular to grant the appeal. For as possession is evidence of title, the judgment might then be said prima facie to relate to a freehold; and whenever the judgment relates to a freehold, an appeal may be regularly granted. But the court, in this case, rendered no judgment of restitution; the only judgment given was for cost, and there is no law authorizing an appeal from a judgment for cost only. No appeal lies on a judgment for cost alone. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with cost. Ky.App. 1821. Briscoe v. Briscoe 3 A.K.Marsh. 498, 10 Ky. 498, 1821 WL 1146 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
