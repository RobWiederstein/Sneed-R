West Headnotes Bills and Notes 56 k 456 56 Bills and Notes 56XI Actions 56k455 Parties Plaintiff 56k456 k. In General. Most Cited Cases The assignee of a note not negotiable cannot maintain an action thereon in his own name;  it must be brought in the name of the payee. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This action having been brought in the name of the assignee upon an obligation not assignable at common law, and under an assignment made prior to the passage of the act authorizing the assignment of such writings, according to the repeated decisions of this court can not be sustained. A note not assignable at common law but assigned before the passage of the act authorizing the transfer of such papers, can not be sued on in the name of the assignee. The judgment in favor of the plaintiff, in the circuit court, must, therefore, be reversed with cost, the cause remanded to that court, and judgment entered in favor of the defendants there, upon their demurrer to his declaration.
