OPINION OF THE COURT BY JUDGE OWSLEY. [Absent Chief Justice Bibb.] To have execution of a judgment which Ford had recovered in the Madison circuit court against Hackett, the former sued out a scire facias, against the latter, returnable to the March term, 1825. Upon this scire facias the sheriff of Madison returned Hackett to be no inhabitant of his county, and not found. Scire facias dated in April was returnable to the next March term and judgment rendered at the June term.____Erroneous. On the 19th of April, 1825, an alias scire facias was sued out against Hackett, returnable to the next March term, and upon which the sheriff again returned that Hackett was no inhabitant of Madison county, and not found. At the June term, 1825, the cause was called, and Hackett failing to appear, judgment was rendered against him. The judgment can not be sustained. The scire facias which last issued, is most clearly insufficient to authorize judgment against Hackett, without his having appeared. Instead of being made returnable to the next term of the court, after its date, as it should regularly have been, the scire facias which bears date in April, 1825, commanded the sheriff to warn Hackett to appear at the next succeeding March term; and not only so, but before the March term, at the June term preceding it, the judgment was taken by default against him. Mesne process must be returnable to the next term. The judgment must be reversed with costs, the cause remanded to the court below, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion.
