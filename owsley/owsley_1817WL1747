(Cite as: 4 Bibb 562,  7 Ky. 562 (Ky.),  1817 WL 1747 (Ky.)) C Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Loftus and Sharp v. Mitchell. Jun. 7, 1817. *1 In a contest between claims as to headright land, the defendant, to bring himself within the law of 1812 must prove that he was actually seated upon the land at the passage of the act. Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. THIS was an ejectment, brought by the appellants to recover the possession of a 400 acre tract of land patented to them in virtue of a County Court certificate granted in 1801, under the act of assembly for settling and improving the vacant lands of this Commonwealth. The appellee claimed the land also under the laws of this country, but his patent being junior to that of the appellants, and he actually residing upon the land, contends that under the 5th section of the act passed 27th January, 1812  (4 Litt. 333), the patent of the appellants, as respects his claim, is altogether inoperative. To bring himself within the protecting influence of the act alluded to, there is no doubt the appellee should be proved to have been actually seated upon the land in contest at the passage of the act. This, from the record in the present case, appears, however, not to be done. He, it is true, proves he had built a cabin and made some other improvements before the passage of the act; but the law clearly distinguishes between improvements of that character and actual residence; and as he is shown to have removed to the land some months after the enactment of the law, the jury unquestionably, in deciding against the appellants, found contrary to evidence; and the Court, upon the motion for that purpose, ought to have awarded a new trial. The judgment must be reversed, the cause remanded, and a new trial had not inconsistent with this opinion. Ky.App. 1817. Loftus v. Mitchell 4 Bibb 562, 7 Ky. 562, 1817 WL 1747 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
