Most Cited  Cases Where complainant has shown himself entitled to some relief, though not to the extent of the claim asserted, he should have a decree for costs. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The note upon which the judgment injoined by this suit was rendered, not having been proven to be given for the same services, for which another note of $50 was given to Benjamin Aills, and for the amount whereof a credit is claimed upon the judgment, the court below properly refused to allow the credit; and as Key appears not to have performed the services for which the note was given upon which the judgment was rendered, Aills most clearly should have a credit for the amount of services not performed, but as by the decree he has obtained that credit, the injunction was no doubt properly dissolved for the residue of the judgment. But as he has shown himself entitled to relief in equity, although not to the amount of the claim asserted, the court ought to have given him a decree for cost. A complainant showing himself entitled to relief, though not to the extent sought, shall have his costs. Because, therefore, cost was refused him, the decree must be reversed, and the cause remanded for a decree to be entered according to this opinion; but as the decree is correct in every other respect, each party must pay their cost in this court.
