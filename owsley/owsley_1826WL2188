(Cite as: 3 T.B.Mon. 406,  19 Ky. 406 (Ky.),  1826 WL 2188 (Ky.)) C Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Manifee's Heirs v. Hyneman &c. Dec. 20, 1826. *1 Absent Defendants. Jurisdiction. ERROR TO THE BATH CIRCUIT; SILAS W. ROBRINS, JUDGE. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. The debts owing by the resident defendants to the absent defendant, (to subject which to the satisfaction of the complainant's demand this suit was brought,) having been appropriated before the commencement of these suits by the absent defendant, to the payment of debts which he was owing to others, the court was undoubtedy correct in refusing to make any decree against the resident defendants; and as the cause is one over which the court could have entertained no jurisdiction, were it not for the allegation in the bill, charging the resident defendants with being indebted to the absent defendant, it follows, that as the complainants have failed to support the charge as to the resident defendants which alone could have authorized the court to take cognizance of the cause, there can be no decree against the absent defendant. If, in a bill against an absent and a resident defendant, to have a demand against the former satisfied out of a debt due by the latter to the former, it appear such debt had been appropriated to another creditor before suit, and the chancellor had not jurisdiction except to subject the resident, no decree can be rendered against the absentee. The decree dismissing the complainant's bill, is, therefore, correct, and must be affirmed, with cost. Triplett, for plaintiff. Ky.App. 1826. Manifee's Heirs v.
