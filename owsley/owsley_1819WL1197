Most Cited Cases A call for "the head of the Middle Fork" of a stream was held not to mean the Main Fork, unless, at the date on the entry, the Main Fork had acquired the reputation of the Middle Fork. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT:FNa1 FNa1. Absent, Judge Rowan. This is a contest for land under adverse claims, and turns upon the validity of the following entry, under which the appellants claim. "1781, March 29--Terrell and Hawkins, assignees, &c. enters a pre-emption warrant of 1,000 acres, No. 1280, on the head of the middle fork of the next creek that runs into Salt River, below Brasheres' creek, on the north side of the said river." Without examining the objections taken in argument to this entry, other than those resulting from the calls to lie on the head of the middle fork, we are of opinion it can not be sustained. A ca?? to lie on the head of the middle fork of a creek with no pre-eminent head either by reputation or in nature, is bad--Vide Ward v. Lee, assignee, fall term, 1808--Scroggs v. Bodley, 1st Marsh. 605--Norvel v. Bodley, Ibid., 606, acc. A call "for the head of the middle fork" of a stream can not mean the main fork, unless at the date of the entry the main fork had acquired the reputation of the middle fork. That there may be streams possessing so pre-eminently a certain and definite source as to communicate to an entry calling for its head sufficient certainty and precision, is not to be controverted, but from the great difficulty which usually occurs as well in ascertaining the true source of, as in discriminating between sources of the same stream, an entry containing a locative call for the head of a water course, as has been frequently heretofore decided, must be considered prima facie bad. And with respect to the entry now in question, instead of removing the unfavorable presumption resulting from the call to lie on the head, the other call for the middle fork demonstrates conclusively its insufficiency. For the record is totally destitute of evidence conducing in the slightest manner to prove that either fork, at the date of the entry, had, by reputation, acquired the name of the "middle fork;" and from the many forks delineated on the connected plat, the one upon which the entry appears to have been surveyed, certainly can not, with more propriety than others, be denominated the "middle fork." The evidence, it is true, proves it to be the largest and main fork; but there is nothing either in the natural or popular acceptation of the term which can justify the inference that, by the call of the middle fork, the locator intended to appropriate land upon the main fork. *2 The decree of the court below, therefore, dismissing the appellant's bill must be affirmed with cost.
