Most Cited  Cases Upon the issue of plene administravit, the jury must find specially, not only the amount of damages, but the amount of assets in the hands of the administrator or executor;  otherwise, the court cannot render judgment upon the verdict. Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. *1 THE only question for discussion in the case is, whether in an action against an administrator, on the trial of an issue joined on the plea of plene administravit, a verdict finding damages generally, without ascertaining the amount of assets, is sufficient? Upon the issue of plene administravit the jury must find specially the amount of assets in the hands of the administrator, other wise the Court cannot render judgment upon the verdict. This question has been decided in the negative by the Court of Appeals in Virginia,  (2 Wash. 301) and by the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of  Fairfax v. Fairfax, 5 Cranch, 19. The same rule was recognized by this Court in the case of Forbes's administrator v. Scobie, fall term 1808. The finding of the jury in this case being of that description, is evidently erroneous. The judgment must be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for new proceedings to be had on the issue joined. Ky.App. 1813. Porter v. Glenn 3 Bibb 86, 6 Ky. 86, 1813 WL 610 (Ky.)
