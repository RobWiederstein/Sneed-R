OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. After having accepted from the Barnses a deed for the land, though it may never have been proved and recorded, Maupin can have no equity to enjoin the collection of the money, which by his contract with Holeman, for the purchase, he stipulated to pay, but to remedy any defects in his title, he should have recourse to the Barnses. It was, therefore, erroneous to decree a perpetuation of the injunction which had been granted Maupin, against the judgment at law recovered by Holeman, for part of the purchase money, and consequently, the decree must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded to the court below, and the bill of Maupin dismissed, with cost and damages. Where the vendee takes the conveyance from another, he can not afterwards enjoin the vendor from collecting the purchase money for defect of title, but must look to the grantor.
