Most Cited Cases (Formerly 233k64) One who has procured possession from plaintiff's tenant will not be permitted to question plaintiff's right. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Turley having obtained the possession of the land in contest, from the tenant of Rodgers, the court below, according to the repeated decisions of this court, decided correctly in refusing to permit him to contest Rodgers' right to recover by shewing an outstanding, superior title in another, when Rodgers leased the land. A def't in ejectment, having procured the possession from the pl'tf's tenant, will not be permitted to question the plaintiff's right. The judgment of that court must be affirmed with cost.
