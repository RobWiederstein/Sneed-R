Form and Sufficiency. Most Cited  Cases Where a common order is taken in a cause, and no plea filed or issue joined, it is error to swear the jury "to try the issue." JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: A common order having been taken in this cause, and no plea filed or issue joined, it was irregular to swear the jury to try the issue, and, consequently, the judgment rendered in favor of the defendant in the circuit, must be reversed with cost, and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. On a common order confirmed, it is irregular to swear the jury to try the issue. Talbot, for appellant; Bibb, contra. Ky.App. 1819. Hopkins v. Preston 2 A.K.Marsh. 64, 9 Ky. 64, 1819 WL 1159 (Ky.)
