Judgment Against Defendant  Where Codefendant Is Not Served with Process. Most Cited Cases In actions against defendants jointly indebted, where one only is served, judgment cannot be entered against him. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The judgment in this cause must be reversed, because it was entered against the appellant only, upon the process being executed on him and returned as to the other defendant in the court below "not found." The cause must be remanded to the court below for further proceedings. In a suit against two, on a joint note, it is error to pronounce judgment against one for the debt, on the sheriff's return as to the other, of "not found." The appellant must recover his cost.
