JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is a writ of error, brought to reverse a judgment rendered against Clarke in the court below, upon an appeal from a judgment of a justice of the peace. By the pleadings in that court, the obligation upon which Clarke sought a recovery is admitted to have given for the purchase of tickets in a lottery set up by him; and as he was not only the complaining party in that court, but now asks a revision of the decision there rendered against him, it becomes material to decide whether the obligation given upon such a consideration, can be sustained. The pleadings seem to have been drawn under an impression, that no other lotteries were, at the time of the giving the obligation in question, interdicted by law, but such as might be composed of blanks and prizes; and to that opinion we should be strongly inclined, were there no other statute in relation to lotteries, but that of 1779, contained in the Chancellor's Revision, 119, and in the Appendix to the 2 vol. Littell. But, deciding this cause under the act of Virginia of 1769, Chan. Rev. 7, although the lottery of Clarke may have been composed entirely of prizes, we can have no hesitation in affirming the judgment rendered against him. No legal obligation can be created on a purchase of tickets in a private lottery. For, as by that act, all lotteries, of whatever description, are expressly interdicted, it follows that no legal obligation can be created by the purchaser of tickets. The judgment must be affirmed with cost. Pope, for plaintiff, Bibb, for defendant in error. Ky.App. 1818. Clarke v. Havens 1 A.K.Marsh. 198, 8 Ky. 198, 1818 WL 1308 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
