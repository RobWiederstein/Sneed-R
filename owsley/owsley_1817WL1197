West Headnotes Assault and Battery 37 k 22 37 Assault and Battery 37I Civil Liability 37I(B) Actions 37k22 k. Parties. Most Cited Cases Plaintiff cannot recover for an assault and battery committed on himself and his wife, in an individual action brought in his own name. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. This was an action of assault and battery, brought by the appellant in his individual name against the appellee. In an individual action of assault and battery to charge the battery to have been committed on the plaintiff and his wife, is irregular. The declaration is clearly, according to the settled doctrine of the common law, erroneous, in charging the appellee with having committed a battery upon both the appellant and his wife, and for that cause the court below correctly arrested the judgment which had been rendered against the appellee, and upon the refusal of the appellant to amend his declaration, properly awarded judgment against him. Judgment affirmed. Ky.App. 1817. Belew v. Prunty Litt.Sel.Cas. 241, 16 Ky. 241, 1817 WL 1197 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
