West Headnotes Ejectment 142 k 53 142 Ejectment 142II Jurisdiction, Parties, Process, and Incidental Proceedings 142k53 k. Declaration and Notice as Process. Most Cited Cases Notice to plead in ejectment is properly served on those, although themselves residing elsewhere, whose slaves live on the land. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This court is of opinion that although the appellees are proven not to reside upon the land in contest, yet as it is shewn to be in the occupancy of their slaves, acting under the superintendence of an overseer employed by the appellees for that purpose, they must be considered as the tenants of the land, and that service of the declaration and notice of ejectment upon them, under such circumstances, though not on the premises, was sufficient, to authorise the taking a common order against them. See 2 Bacon, 409, in note: 2 Strange, 1064: Runnington, Eject. 155. Notice in ejectment is properly served on those whose slaves live on land, though the masters reside elsewhere. Because, therefore, the court below, upon proof of such a service on the appellees, refused to award a common order, but ordered the cause to be stricken from the docket, the judgment of that court must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion.
