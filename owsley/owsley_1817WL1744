Dec. 9, 1817. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE FAYETTE CIRCUIT COURT. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This court is of opinion, that under the statute of jeofails of 1799, no exceptions can be taken after verdict, to a replication, alleging in reply, to the plea of usury, "that the contract on which the suit is founded, is not corrupt or usurious, but is bona fide and fair for the sum stated in the note upon which the suit is brought;" and as there is no other point made in this cause, but what has been heretofore decided upon, and held to be untenable by this court, the judgment must be affirmed with cost and damages.
