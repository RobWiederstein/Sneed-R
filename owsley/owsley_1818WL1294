Apr. 10, 1818. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE MONTGOMERY CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Landlord and Tenant 233 k 1751(2) 233 Landlord and Tenant 233VIII Reentry and Recovery of Possession by Landlord 233VIII(C) Actions for Recovery of Possession 233k1747 Right to Maintain Action and Conditions  Precedent 233k1751 Demand or  Notice 233k1751(2) k. Necessity. Most Cited  Cases (Formerly 233k283) A landlord is not bound to give his tenant notice to quit, if the tenant has taken protection under an adverse claim. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: If, as tenant to the appellant, the appellee would otherwise have been entitled to notice to quit, it is clear, that by his taking protection under an adverse title before the commencement of the present action, he has rendered the giving such a notice by the appellant unnecessary. A landlord is not bound to give his tenant notice to quit if the tenant has taken protection under an adverse claim. Because, therefore, the court below instructed the jury that the appellant could not recover, without making proof that the appellee had six months' notice to quit, the judgment must be reversed, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. The appellant must recover his cost in this suit. Pope, for appellant. Ky.App. 1818. Williams v. Hensley 1 A.K.Marsh. 181, 8 Ky. 181, 1818 WL 1294 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
