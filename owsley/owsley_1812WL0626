Judge WALLACE absent. *1 THIS is a suit in chancery prosecuted in the Clark Circuit Court by Jackson against Taylor and Talbot. The process appears to have been executed previous to the passage of the law dispensing with the necessity of serving a copy of the bill on the defendant. Taylor and Talbot failed to make defense, and the bill was taken as confessed, and a decree had against them. It has been frequently adjudged by this Court, that it is erroneous to take a bill for confessed, where the sheriff has failed to return the subpena executed by delivering a copy of the bill to the defendant. The sheriff has not made such a return in this cause; it does not appear that a copy of the bill was delivered to either of the defendants. The proceeding in taking the bill as confessed is therefore erroneous. It is therefore decreed by this Court that the proceedings and decree of the Clark Circuit Court, be reversed, that the cause be remanded to that Court for further proceedings; but inasmuch as the law does not at this time require a copy of the bill to be served upon either of the defendants, new proceedings should commence at the return of the subpena executed. And it is further decreed that the defendant in error pay the plaintiffs their costs, etc. Ky.App. 1812. Taylor v. Jackson 2 Bibb 572, 5 Ky. 572, 1812 WL 626 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
