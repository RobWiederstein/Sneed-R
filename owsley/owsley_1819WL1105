May 29, 1819. *1 ON A WRIT OF ERROR TO REVERSE A JUDGMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Assumpsit, Action Of 42 k 20 42 Assumpsit, Action Of 42k17 Pleading 42k20 k. Plea or Affidavit of Defense. Most Cited Cases A plea which impeaches part only of the consideration of the promise is bad. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This writ of error is brought to reverse a judgment rendered against Coleman, upon a demurrer to two pleas filed by him in an action of debt prosecuted by Harper in the court below. The object of each plea is to question the consideration of the obligation upon which the suit is founded. A plea impeaching the consideration partially, can not be sustained. A plea is bad which impeaches the consideration, unless it also shews how the consideration has failed. We think, however, that neither of the pleas can be sustained. The first cannot--because it impeaches the consideration partially only. And the second can not--because it barely alleges (without stating in what way) a failure of the consideration. A general denial of the obligation having been given upon any consideration, as the plaintiff must be presumed to know the consideration, would, no doubt, be good. But a general averment of the consideration having failed, as the plaintiff can not be presumed to know how the failure happened, is too uncertain to require from him a replication. The judgment of the court must, therefore, be affirmed with cost and damages. Bibb for plaintiff in error. Ky.App. 1819. Coleman v. Harper 1 A.K.Marsh. 602, 8 Ky. 602, 1819 WL 1105 (Ky.)
