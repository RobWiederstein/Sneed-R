Most Cited  Cases On covenant to pay $185 by a day certain, conditioned to be void on the procurement of a deed of certain land, and containing the further provision that, if the land was not conveyed by a certain prior day, then $45 was to be paid on the latter date, the money and not the value of the land is the measure of damages for failure to convey. Opinion of the Court by Judge LOGAN. Judge OWSLEY absent. THIS is an action of covenant, on a writing bearing date the 25th of November, 1805, for the payment of $185, on or before the 25th of December, 1806, conditioned to be void on the procurement of a deed from John Fowler, for a certain tract of land; but containing this further provision, that if the land were not conveyed by the 15th of January, 1806, then $45 of the above note was to be paid on that day. Under this writing and evidence of the value of the land, on the 15th of January, 1806, the jury found a verdict for $366 75 cents. The first question we think necessary to notice under the assignment of errors, is with respect to the measure of damages. And the only manner this question comes properly before the Court, is from the construction of the writing in fixing the damages in the event of a failure to convey the land. The parties having agreed on $185 as the sum to be paid by a given day, with the condition to be void by a conveyance of land within that period; but if the land were not conveyed by the 15th of January, 1806, that then $45 of the above note should be paid at that time, seems to the Court to refer to the sum of $185, and thereby adopt it as the measure of the demand, with interest on the sums as they became payable: but the verdict and judgment having gone for a much larger sum is, therefore, erroneous. The judgment must be reversed with costs, and remanded for new proceedings. Ky.App. 1812. Hopkins v. Youmans 2 Bibb 536, 5 Ky. 536, 1812 WL 609 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
