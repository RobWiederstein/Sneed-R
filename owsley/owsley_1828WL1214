Judgment in Excess of Demand. Most Cited  Cases Where the judgment is for more than was claimed by plaintiff in his declaration, and greater than the evidence warrants, it will be reversed. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. Stewart leased of Tevis a house and lot in the town of Richmond, for the term of three years, and covenanted to pay, annually, therefor, one hundred and fifty dollars. Suit was brought by Tevis upon the covenant, and breaches assigned in the non-payment of each year's rent. Stewart made default, and a writ of enquiry was awarded to assess damages. Five hundred and twenty-three dollars damages was assessed by the jury, and judgment rendered therefor against Stewart. To reverse that judgment this writ of error is prosecuted. The judgment can not be sustained. The damages assessed by the jury, are unjust and excessive, and beyond what the court was bound, ex officio, to know the plaintiff in that court was entitled to recover. Where the jury assess damages not warranted by the allegations of the declaration, the court ought, ex officio, to set it aside, and if it be not done this court will reverse the judgment and direct it. Judgment ought not, therefore, to have been rendered for the amount of damages assessed, but the inquest of damages ought to have been, ex officio, set aside by the court, as was decided by this court, in the case of Tucker v.  Smith, 1 Littell, 209. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed, with cost, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
