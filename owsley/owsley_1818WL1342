Most Cited  Cases It is proper to permit a plaintiff, without accounting for the absence of the surveyor and those who were present when the original survey was made, to prove by other witnesses a correspondence between the corner-trees and marked lines called for in his patent and those found on the land in contest. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The court below properly permitted the appellee, who was plaintiff in that court, without accounting for the absence of the surveyor and those who were present when the original survey was made, to prove by other witnesses, a correspondence between the corner trees and marked lines, called for in his patent, and those found upon the land in contest; and they moreover correctly refused to discharge the order awarding the habere facias possessionem, on the ground (urged by the appellant) of no judgment being taken against the tenants in possession; those tenants having taken possession under the appellant, and for whom the appellant was permitted to defend, by pleading the general issue. The correspondence of lines and corners found on the ground, with those called for in the patent, may be proved by others than the surveyor and chain men, without accounting for their absence. When a landlord defends and pleads for his tenant, the habere facias rightfully issues vs. the tenant in possession. The judgment must be affirmed with cost. Hardin, for appellant. Ky.App. 1818.
