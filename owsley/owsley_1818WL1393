Oct. 14, 1818. *1 ON A WRIT OF ERROR TO REVERSE A JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF KNOX. West Headnotes Frauds, Statute Of 185 k 148(1) 185 Frauds, Statute Of 185X Pleading 185k145 Pleading Contract or Transaction Within Statute 185k148 Writing or Other Compliance with Statute 185k148(1) k. In General. Most Cited  Cases Where suit is brought on a contract in relation to lands, it is not necessary to allege in the declaration that the contract was in writing. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This case turns upon the decision of the court below in overruling the motion of Drace, made in arrest o?? judgment. The motion was predicated upon the idea of the declaration being defective, in not alleging the promise upon which the suit is brought, to have been in writing. In an action on a promise relating to the sale of land, the declaration need not state the promise to have been made in writing, but to justify a recovery, the proof must be that the promise was written. As the promise purports to relate to the sale of an interest in land, there is no doubt, according to the statut?? against frauds and perjuries, that Wyat, to authorize a recovery, should have proven the promise, or some memorandum or not thereof, to have been in writing. But, although that description of evidence should have been introduced, yet, according to the settled construction of the statute, it is not necessary that the declaration should contain an averment of the promise having been reduced to writing. Without such an averment the declaration is good at common law, and the statute has never been construed to alter the manner of declaring, but is held barely to change the character of the evidence necessary to support the action. Judgment must be affirmed with cost. Talbot, for appellant. Ky.App. 1818. Drace v. Wyat 1 A.K.Marsh. 336, 8 Ky. 336, 1818 WL 1393 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
