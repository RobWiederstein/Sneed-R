Bonds and Liability Thereon. Most Cited  Cases On traverse of an inquisition, if the security executes the bond it is sufficient, though not executed by his principal. Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. *1 SMITH obtained from a justice of the peace a warrant for a forcible detainer against Turley. The jury summoned on the inquisition, found Turley not guilty, whereupon judgment was awarded him by the justice. Upon traverse of an inquisition of forcible entry and detainer, if the security executes the bond it is sufficient altho' not executed by the principal--Accord. Hard. 149, 173. Smith, according to the provision of the act regulating such proceedings, filed a traverse, and brought the cause before the Circuit Court. That Court, on the motion of Turley, quashed the traverse and dismissed the cause. For what causes of irregularity the cause was dismissed, does not appear from the record. It is, however, objected, the bond given upon filing the traverse, does not appear to have been regularly executed, because it appears to have been signed by Smith's agent, without his authority appearing in the record. The bond appears to have been taken as the law requires by the justice before whom the inquest was had. The failure then to file the authority under which the agent executed the bond, surely cannot justify a quashal of the traverse and dismissing the cause, when the justice has certified the bond to have been approved by and acknowledged before him. Besides, the bond was regularly executed by Smith's security. The judgment of the Circuit Court, therefore, is erroneous and must be reversed with costs. The cause remanded for further proceeding to be had upon the traverse. Ky.App. 1813. Smith v. Turley 3 Bibb 188, 6 Ky. 188, 1813 WL 643 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
