Most Cited  Cases An order establishing a ferry on the Ohio river is improper, where the record fails to show that the person on whose application the order was made owned the land on the Kentucky shore of the river. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. The order establishing the ferry in this case, is erroneous, because the record fails to show that the heirs of Ferguson, upon whose application it was made, are the owners of the land on the Kentucky shore of the Ohio river, as was decided to be necessary to authorize the establishment of a ferry across the Ohio river, in the case of the trustees of the Jefferson Seminary v. Wagnon, 2 Marshall, 379. Record establishing a ferry on the Ohio, must shew the applicant owned the land on the Kentucky shore. The order is therefore reversed with cost.
