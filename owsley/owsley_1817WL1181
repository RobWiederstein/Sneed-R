Most Cited  Cases Under Act 1793, s 6, regulating taverns and restraining tippling houses, providing that no fine shall be imposed upon any person for selling liquor at any place whatever, made from the production of his own farm, unless sold to be drunk in his house, it is no offense to sell cider made from the production of the seller's farm, when not drunk within the premises in which it was sold. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is an appeal, brought to reverse a judgment rendered against the appellant, upon a presentment for retailing cider by the quart, in the town of Paris. A person selling cider by the quart in a public street, (it being the product of his own farm,) is not within the purview of the act restraining tipling houses. This court is of opinion, that according to the proviso contained in the sixth section of the act of 1793,FNa regulating taverns and restraining tippling houses, that no fine should be imposed upon any persons for selling liquors, at any place whatever, made from the production of their own farms, unless sold to be drunk in their house; and as the cider sold by the appellant, was admitted to have been made from the production of his farm, judgment ought not to have been rendered against him. The judgment must therefore, be reversed. FNa.  1 Litt. 197. Talbot for appellant; Blair, attorney general, contra. Ky.App. 1817. Current v. Com. 1 A.K.Marsh. 121, 8 Ky. 121, 1817 WL 1181 (Ky.)
