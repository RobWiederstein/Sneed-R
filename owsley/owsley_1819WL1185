(Cite as: 2 A.K.Marsh. 148,  9 Ky. 148 (Ky.),  1819 WL 1185 (Ky.)) Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Edward & Head v. Jonathan Taylor et al. Dec. 11, 1819. *1 ON APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Bonds 58 k 123 58 Bonds 58V Actions 58k123 k. Pleading. Most Cited Cases (Formerly 58k125) A plea impeaching a part only of the consideration of a bond is not valid. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This was an action of covenant brought in the court below by Head. Judgment in bar of the action was rendered by that court on a demurrer to Head's replication to the appellees' fifth plea. The plea appears to have been intended to impeach the consideration upon which the obligation declared on was given; but as it goes to part only of the consideration, according to the repeated decisions of this court, it presents no sufficient bar to the action. A plea impeaching the consideration of a bond partially is not valid. 1st Marsh., 168, 177, 602, acc. Without noticing, therefore, other objections which might be taken to the plea, we have no doubt the court erred in sustaining the appellees' demurrer and giving judgment in bar of the action. The judgment must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. Pope for appellant, Bibb and Hardin contra. Ky.App. 1819. Edward v.
