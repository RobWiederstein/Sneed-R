Public Lands in General. Most Cited  Cases One cannot be considered as having been in adverse possession of land against a claimant under a patent of the commonwealth, during any time previous to the issuing of such patent. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This case turns upon the propriety of the decision of the court below in refusing to award the appellant a new trial in an action of ejectment brought by him in that court against the appellee. A plaintiff in ejectment whose patent is not twenty years old when he brings his suit, is not barred by 20 years adverse possession,-- the plaintiff's right of entry ommences with his patent. The appellee relied upon an adverse possession for twenty years; but as the appellant's right of entry is shewn to have accrued within twenty years, according to the case of Chiles against Calk, (4th Bibb, 544), the court improperly held this action to be barred by such a possession. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and a new trial had, not inconsistent with this opinion. Pope, for appellant; Bibb, for appellee. Ky.App. 1817. Stewart v.
