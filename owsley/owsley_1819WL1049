Ferries 172 k 14 172 Ferries 172I Establishment and Maintenance 172k9 Franchises and Privileges 172k14 k. Proceedings to Acquire. Most Cited  Cases The omission, in an order establishing a ferry, to fix the rate of ferriage, does not furnish sufficient ground for reversing the order. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: By the assignment of errors in this case, three questions are presented for the consideration of this court: 1. Have the county court erred in establishing the ferry? 2. Should the order of establishment be reversed, for the failure of the court, at that time, in fixing the rates of ferriage? 3. Ought judgment for cost to have been given in favor of the applicant? With respect to the first question, it need only to remarked, that from the record, Oldham, in whose favor the ferry is established, appears to be the owner of the land on both sides of the stream, and so far from exhibiting any infraction of the statutes regulating such proceedings, the bill of exceptions taken by Ackler demonstrates, satisfactorily, the correctness of the decision of the county court, in ordering the ferry to be established. And as to the second question, there is no doubt but that the court ought to have fixed the rates of ferriage, but as to do so must necessarily require a subsequent order to that establishing the ferry, the omission to fix the rates, we suppose can not operate to reverse the order of establishment. But with respect to the third question, we are of opinion cost should not have been given against Ackler. The general laws concerning cost, certainly do not embrace the case, and the statute regulating the establishment of ferries, no where authorizes the giving cost. On the establishment of a ferry, it is error to give costs against him who opposes it. The order establishing the ferry, therefore, must be affirmed, but the judgment for cost must be reversed; but each party must pay his own cost in this court. Bibb, for plaintiff; Hardin, for defendant in error. Ky.App. 1819. Ackler v. Oldham 1 A.K.Marsh. 471, 8 Ky. 471, 1819 WL 1049 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
