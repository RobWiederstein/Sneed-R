(Cite as: 1 A.K.Marsh. 589,  8 Ky. 589 (Ky.),  1819 WL 1812 (Ky.)) Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Elijah Neale v. James Cogar. Jun. 12, 1819. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM AN ORDER OF THE JESSAMINE COUNTY COURT. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Although when the applicant is the owner of the land on but one side of a stream, it is necessary the record giving leave to build a mill should contain a suggestion whether or not the bed of the stream belongs to the applicant or the commonwealth, we are of opinion such a suggestion is not necessary, when the applicant is shewn to be the owner of the lands on both sides of the stream. If an applicant for leave to build a mill, owns one side only of the stream, the inquest should state in whom the bed is--secus if he holds both sides. In the present case, therefore, as the Neales appear to be the owners of the lands on both sides of the stream, the inquisition should not, on account of the record containing no suggestion to whom the bed belongs, have been quashed. The order of the county court must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. Pope for appellant, Bibb for appellee. Ky.App. 1819.
