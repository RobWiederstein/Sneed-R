CRITTENDEN for Whitnell; no attorney on the other side. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. This is an appeal from a judgment rendered in favor of the justices of the county court of Caldwell county, against Whitnell, for not having discharged the amount of the county levy, which was levied for the year 1818, and of which Whitnell, as sheriff of the county, was made collector by the order of the court. The county court attorney is the proper officer to give notice to the collector of the county levy, of a motion for a judgment for failing to pay it over. Various questions are raised by the assignment of errors. First, it is contended that the notice which was given Whitnell of the intended application for a judgment is insufficient. No specific exception is, however, taken to the notice, and no substantial objection is perceived by the court. The notice, it is true, appears to have been drawn up by the attorney for the county court, and contains a suggestion, that, on behalf of the court, the attorney would move the court for a judgment against Whitnell, for the amount of levy collected by him in 1817 and 1818; but no objection is perceived to uniting in the same notice, the levy for both years; and, as the officer of the court, it was, no doubt, competent for the attorney to give the notice. *2 The levy for two succeeding years may be included in one notice. But it is secondly objected, that it was irregular for the court, upon a notice in its own favor, to render judgment in behalf of itself, against Whitnell. The answer to this objection is found in the act of the legislature of this country, concerning county levies. The act explicitly authorises the county court, after giving to the sheriff or collector ten days' previous notice, to enter judgment against him for whatever may appear to be due of the levy, upon his failure to account for the same. The act has not, in express language, directed the judgment to be entered in the name of the justices of the county court; but they are made the organs of the law, by whom the levy is to be laid, and to whom the collector is to account, and according to the most obvious import of the act, in whose names judgment ought to be rendered against the collector, for a failure to account to them for the levy. Such judgment is properly rendered in favor of the justices of the county court, and may nevertheless be rendered by them notwithstanding they are plaintiffs in the motion. Such other objections as merit any answer, are properly involved in the question, whether or not, upon the evidence given, the court was correct in rendering judgment against Whitnell? That it was correct, we entertain no doubt. The evidence is ample, and proves, conclusively, every fact necessary to show the liability of Whitnell and the propriety of the judgment which was rendered against him. Judgment affirmed with costs and damages. Ky.App. 1823. Whitnell v. Justices of Caldwell County 4 Litt. 147, 14 Ky. 147, 1823 WL 1240 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
