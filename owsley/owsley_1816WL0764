Jun. 1, 1816. *1 A Court of Equity will not grant a new trial in an action at law on the ground that the party was surprised; application should have been made to the Court at Law at the term it was tried. Nor on the discovery of other evidence, when it is not shown that if it had been used on the trial a different result would have been produced, and when that evidence goes only to impeach the credit of one of the other party's witnesses.

Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. THIS is an appeal from a decree of the Court below, dismissing the bill of Barrett, exhibited for the purpose of obtaining a new trial in an action of ejectment previously prosecuted by Belshe, and in whose favor a judgment had been obtained against Barrett. The grounds alleged in the bill for a new trial are--1. Surprise, by the production of evidence on the trial; and 2. The discovery of evidence since the trial. With respect to the allegation of surprise, there can be no doubt but what Barrett has altogether failed to show a sufficient cause for relief. If he was surprised upon the trial at law, he must have then known it, and as that Court was competent to give him relief, he should have applied there; but as he has not done so, nor shown any excuse for his failure, he ought not to be relieved in equity. Nor do we suppose he should be relieved on the ground of a discovery of evidence. 1. Because he has not shown by allegation that if the evidence discovered had been used on the former trial, it would even in probability have produced a different result. And 2. Because the evidence discovered goes only to impeach the credit of one of the witnesses of Belshe; and according to the settled doctrine in relation to that subject, for such a discovery a new trial ought not to be granted.--See 2 Sal. 653--3 John.
