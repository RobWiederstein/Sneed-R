(Cite as: 3 A.K.Marsh. 489,  10 Ky. 489 (Ky.),  1821 WL 1760 (Ky.)) C Court of Appeals of Kentucky. James Vance v. James Wier. Jun. 7, 1821. *1 ON A WRIT OF ERROR TO REVERSE A DECREE OF THE FAYETTE CIRCUIT COURT. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This writ of error is prosecuted to reverse a decree pronounced in favor of Wier, in a suit brought by him, in the circuit court against Vance. The object of the suit was to be relieved from a judgment at law recovered by Vance on an obligation given by Lewis Sanders, together with Wier his surety, on the ground of the contract between Vance and Sanders being usurious; and by the decree of the circuit court Wier's injunction was made perpetual for the interest reversed and cost. We have deemed it unnecessary to go into a minute detail of the facts and circumstances exhibited in the record, as the case presents no new principle and must turn exclusively on the question whether or not the contract, between Vance and Sanders, was usurious, and if usurious, as to the amount for which Wier has shewn himself entitled to relief. We will suggest, however, that the evidence satisfactorily proves the contract to be usurious, and the amount decreed to Wier is not for more than the evidence shews him to be entitled to. The decree must be affirmed with cost. Wickliffe, for plaintiff, Haggin, for defendant in error. Ky.App. 1821. Vance v. Wier 3 A.K.Marsh. 489, 10 Ky. 489, 1821 WL 1760 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
