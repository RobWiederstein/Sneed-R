Apr. 4, 1821. *1 ON APPEAL FROM A DECREE OF THE LINCOLN CIRCUIT COURT. COURT. West Headnotes Equity 150 k 105 150 Equity 150III Parties and Process 150k102 Complainants 150k105 k. Joinder. Most Cited Cases Persons holding different parcels of land derived from the same source may unite in a suit brought to investigate the validity of the common claim. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This writ of error, is brought to reverse a decree pronounced by the circuit court, sustaining the defendants' demurrer to the complainants' bill, and dismissing the bill with costs. The case of Tilford, &c., against Emerson, &c., 1 Marshall, 483, is decisive against the decree of the circuit court. In that case it was hald, that different persons holding different parcels of land, but derived from the same source, might unite in a suit brought to investigate the validity of the common claim. In this case, the Scrimegers claim distinct parcels of the same tract, and their bill was exhibited for the purpose of investigating the validity of the entry under which they both claim. Persons holding distinct parcels of land under the same common title, may unite in a suit for adjusting the common title. The decree must therefore be reversed with cost, and the cause remanded, and leave given to the defendants to answer the bill; but if they should fail to answer within such time as the court may direct, the complainants' bill may be considered as confessed, and a decree rendered according to the equity of their case.
