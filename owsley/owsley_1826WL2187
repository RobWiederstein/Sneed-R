(Cite as: 3 T.B.Mon. 390,  19 Ky. 390 (Ky.),  1826 WL 2187 (Ky.)) C Court of Appeals of Kentucky. White v. Clarke &c. Dec. 19, 1826. *1 Rescission of Contract for Personalty. ERROR TO THE MADISON CIRCUIT; GEORGE SHANNON, JUDGE. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. This was a bill in equity, exhibited by White, in the circuit court, for the purpose of setting aside a contract, and having delivered up to be cancelled, a note, which, under the contract, was executed by him to Green for one hundred dollars commonwealth's paper, the price of a grey mare purchased by White from Clarke, whilst she belonged to Green. Contract for a horse rescinded on the bill of the purchaser, and perpetual injunction to a judgment recovered on the note for the purchase money. The bill sets out the contract of purchase, with all the concomitant circumstances, and alleges everything necessary, to show that the complainant ought to be relieved, and the contract cancelled, and the testimony in the cause goes satisfactorily to prove and establish, all the material facts alleged in the bill. Instead, therefore of dismissing the bill, the court below, should have pronounced a decree for relief in favor of the complainant. The decree must consequently be reversed with costs, the cause remanded to that court, and a decree there entered in conformity to this opinion. Turner for plaintiff. Ky.App. 1826. White v.
