JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: We are of opinion that the court below improperly admitted as evidence against Walker, the certificate of John T. Evans, made after the dissolution of the partnership between Walker and Evans, acknowledging that the partnership firm was indebted to the defendant, Duberry, the sum demanded in the action brought by him in the court below. See 3 Johnst. Rep. 536; 3 Mumf. Rep. 191. The admission of a partner, after the dissolution of the partnership, is no evidence against the firm. The judgment of that court must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had, not inconsistent with this opinion. Bibb, for appellants; Haggin, for appellee. Ky.App. 1818.
