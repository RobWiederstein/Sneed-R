In General. Most Cited Cases An inquest on a writ of ad quod damnum, on a mill seat, is fatally defective if it omits to state whether or not the health of the neighbors will be affected. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Because the inquisition taken in this cause contains no statement, whether or not the health of the neighbors will be annoyed, the court erroneously gave leave to build the mill. An order establishing a mill is erroneous, where the inquest does not state whether the health of the neighbors will be annoyed. The order of the county court must, therefore, be reversed, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. Bibb, for plaintiff; Pope, for defendant in error.
