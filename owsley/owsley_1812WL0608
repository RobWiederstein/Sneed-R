Most Cited Cases An action of ejectment by woman is not abated by her marriage pending suit. Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. Judge WALLACE absent. *1 THE question in this case is, whether where the lessor of the plaintiff in ejectment is a feme, the action will abate by her marriage? It was decided in this Court in the case of  Robertson v. Morgan (5 Ky. 148), that an action of ejectment would not abate by the death of the lessor of the plaintiff, and the same doctrine has been recognized by the Court of Appeals of Virginia--See 1 Hen. and Mun. 531. If this doctrine be correct, of which there can be no doubt, it follows very clearly that the marriage of the lessor of the plaintiff, she being a feme, will not have the effect to abate the suit.--Judgment affirmed, etc. Ky.App. 1812.
