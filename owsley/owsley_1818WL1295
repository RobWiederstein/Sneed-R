JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The court is of opinion that it was regular for the court below, at a subsequent term after the rendering the judgment of eviction in favor of the defendant in error, upon the application of the plaintiff in error, and in the presence of the other party to appoint commissioners for the purpose of assessing the rents and improvements, &c., under the act of 1797; and that it was consequently irregular, after the report of the commissioners was returned, for the court to quash it, upon the hypothesis that the commissioners were improperly appointed. It is correct for the court pronouncing judgment of eviction, to appoint commissioners under the occupying claimant law, at a subsequent term, both parties being present. The judgment of that court therefore, quashing the report of the commissioners, must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings there had not inconsistent with this opinion.
