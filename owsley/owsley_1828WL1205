In General. Most Cited  Cases (Formerly 92k179) An act suspending the enforcement of a judgment for a limited time is unconstitutional, as applied to judgments rendered before its passage. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. Case stated. The administrator of Stevenson brought an action at law, against David McAlexander and Wm. Barnett, on a note executed by them to the intestate, the twenty-seventh of April, 1816, for two hundred and sixty-four dollars thirty-two cents, payable twelve months after date, with interest from the date. Judgment was recovered by the administratrix for the amount of the note, with interest and cost, against McAlexander and Barnett, and on the 24th of July, 1826, thereafter, an execution was issued against their estate, for the amount of the judgment. The execution was levied on the estate of the defendant, Wm. Barnett, and on the 5th of September, 1826, he, together with Joseph Barnett, replevied the debt, by executing bond for the payment of the amount and interest, within three months. The Barnetts, by whom the bond was executed, afterwards moved the circuit court of Madison county to quash the bond, and the court being of opinion, that instead of being payable, within three months, the bond ought to have been made payable within two years, quashing the bond. The cases of Blair, &c. v. Williams, and Lapsley v. Brashear, &c., 4 Littell's Reports, are decisive against the circuit court, and the principle adjudged in these cases is still approved. Acts allowing a replevin of two years unconstitutional as to contracts made before the enactment, according to Lapsley and Brashear, and Blair and Williams. A majority of the court, the Chief Justice dissenting, are, therefore, of opinion that the judgment of the circuit court quashing the bond, must be reversed, with cost, the cause remanded to the circuit court, and the motion of the defendants in error overruled, with cost. Turner, for plaintiff; Breck, for defendants. Chief Justice dissenting. Ky.App. 1828. Stephenson's Adm'r v. Barnett 7 T.B.Mon. 50, 23 Ky. 50, 1828 WL 1205 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
