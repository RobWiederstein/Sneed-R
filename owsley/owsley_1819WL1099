Most Cited  Cases If an inquisition on a mill seat respond to each requisite of the law, it will be presumed that the sheriff charged the jury properly. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This is an appeal from an order of the county court, giving Cogar leave to build a mill. An inquisition on a mill seat should regularly shew that the jury were charged according to law; but if the inquest responds to each requisite, it will be presumed that the jury were so charged. In most cases the inquest should prescribe the height of the dam; but if the applicant holds both sides of the stream, and from the abuttment to the bead, the height of the dam may be omitted. The questions presented for the consideration of this court grow out of objections taken to the inquisition. It is contended, 1st, that the inquisition should have set forth specifically the charge given by the sheriff to the jury. And 2dly, the inquisition is supposed to be defective in not stating the height of the dam designed to be erected. There is no question but the sheriff should have charged the jury in pursuance to the requisitions of the act regulating such proceedings, but having returned an inquisition containing a response to every enquiry which the jury should have been charged to make, the sheriff should be presumed to have done his duty in charging the jury according to the requisitions of the law. And with respect to the dam, it may, in most cases, be proper as a means to estimate the probable damage to others, for the jury to fix upon its height; but in the present case, as Cogar, the appellant, appears not only to own the land on both sides of the stream whereon the mill is proposed to be erected, but from thence to the head of the stream also, the interest of others can not have rendered it expedient for the jury to fix upon the height of the dam, and as the law is silent upon the subject, the inquest should not, on that ground, be quashed. *2 The order of the county court must be affirmed with cost.
