West Headnotes Pretrial Procedure 307A k 712 307A Pretrial Procedure 307AIV Continuance 307Ak712 k. Right to continuance in general. Most Cited Cases (Formerly 94k54  Continuance) An objection that a continuance was not entered at the first term comes too late after verdict at a subsequent term. Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. THE original writ in this case was made returnable to, and executed before the September term of the Mercer Circuit Court, in the year 1813, and without any order continuing the cause at that term, the Court at a subsequent term, after a verdict having been found for the plaintiff there, gave judgment; and the assignment of errors questions the propriety of proceeding in that Court after the failure to enter a continuance of the cause at the September term. Without inquiring what effect that failure might have produced had exceptions been taken to it before a trial in the Court below, we have no doubt but under our statute of jeofails the objection comes too late after verdict.--Judgment affirmed with costs and damages.
