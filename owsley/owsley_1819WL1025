JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: *1 We are of opinion that, according to the plain import of the declaration filed in the court below by the defendants in error, the covenant, upon which the action is founded, was most obviously given by Scott, the plaintiff in error, to Hugh A. Anderson and John Perry. Anderson and Perry, therefore, are clearly entitled to any damages which may have accrued upon a breach of the covenant; and, consequently for the recovery of those damages, the action ought to be brought in their names, and in their names only. A covenant entered into by one in favor of two others, can not be sued on by the two to whom it was given together with a third person. Because, therefore, the present action has been prosecuted in the names of Anderson, Perry and Patton, it can not be sustained, and the judgment rendered therein against Scott, must consequently be reversed with cost, the cause remanded to the court below, and the action dismissed with cost.
