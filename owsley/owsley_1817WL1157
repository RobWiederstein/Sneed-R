Most Cited  Cases Defendant in ejectment cannot defend himself by showing an outstanding patent of equal date with plaintiff, unless he also shows a privity between himself and the outstanding patent. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The judgment in this case must be reversed, because the court instructed the jury that they were bound to find for the appellee, who was defendant in the court below, in consequence of his having produced in evidence a patent emanating under an adverse claim to that of the appellant, but which is of the same date, without also requiring the production of any evidence to shew that the appellee either entered or held the possession under the patentee or some person claiming through him, requiring the appellee to manifest in any manner a conection between his claim and that of the patent introduced by him. See the case of  Bowman against Bartlett, &c., 4 Bibb, 520. A deft. in ejectment can not defend himself by shewing an outstanding patent of equal date with the pltf. unless he also shews a privity between himself and the outstanding patent. The appellant must recover his cost in this suit. Littell, for pltf. in error; Talbot, contra. Ky.App. 1817. Breckenridge v. Beard 1 A.K.Marsh. 64, 8 Ky. 64, 1817 WL 1157 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
