Oct. 18, 1819. *1 ON APPEALS FROM TWO DECREES OF THE FAYETTE CIRCUIT COURT. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The appellant, who was complainant in these suits, having obtained decrees, not only for every thing asked for in his bills, but for all which, either according to his own statement or the exhibits and proof in the causes, he could possibly have been entitled to demand, can have had no just cause of resorting to this court. The decrees must, therefore, be affirmed with costs. Wickliffe, for appellant; Haggin, for appellees. Ky.App. 1819. Turner v. Sanders 2 A.K.Marsh. 44, 9 Ky. 44, 1819 WL 1818 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
