Judgment or Decree. Most Cited  Cases In an action against heirs on a bond of their ancestor, the judgment should be as of their own debt. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT:FNa1 FNa1. Absent, Judge Rowan. The judgment in this case having been taken in the court below by default, was correctly rendered against the heirs as for their personal debt, but should have been entered against the executor, to be levied out of the assets in his hands to be administered. A judgment against an heir is as if for his own debt against an executor de bonis testatoris. 1 Marsh., 314, acc. Because, therefore, the judgment is against the executor in his personal right, it must be reversed with cost, and the cause remanded, and judgment entered according to the principles of this opinion.
