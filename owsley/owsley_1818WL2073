(Cite as: 1 A.K.Marsh. 341,  8 Ky. 341 (Ky.),  1818 WL 2073 (Ky.)) Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Charles Eastin v. Charles Bell et al. Oct. 15, 1818. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE HENRY CIRCUIT COURT. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The appellees having, in an action of detinue, obtained a verdict for the slaves in contest, the appellant applied to the court for a new trial, and moved the court to continue his application until the next term; but the court refused the continuance, and overruled the application for a new trial; and after exceptions were taken to the opinion of the court, as well in refusing the continuance, as in overruling the application for a new trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the appellees upon the verdict of the jury. The motion for a continuance was made for the purpose of affording to the appellant an opportunity of searching for a deposition, which had been used upon the trial, but which was alleged to be lost, in order that he might avail himself of its contents upon the decision of his application for a new trial. But as the contents of the deposition must, in all reasonable probability, have been known to the court and parties, we have no doubt but that the court properly refused the continuance. And with respect to the overruling of the application for a new trial, we are unable to perceive any solid objection. The only ground for a new trial, worthy of consideration is that of the verdict being contrary to evidence; but upon a thorough examination of the record we are totally unable to discover any thing calculated to warrant the intervention of this court, contrary to the opinion of the court below, in awarding a new trial. Judgment must be affirmed with cost. Hardin for appellant, Bibb and Wickliffe for appellee. Ky.App. 1818. Eastin v. Bell 1 A.K.Marsh. 341, 8 Ky. 341, 1818 WL 2073 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
