West Headnotes Executors and Administrators 162 k 43 162 Executors and Administrators 162III Assets of Estate 162III(A) In General 162k43 k. Personal Property in General. Most Cited  Cases Under the act of 1800, declaring that slaves devised shall be deemed real estate, and pass under the same regulations as landed property, slaves are not assets in the hands of the personal representative, but pass, without his assent, to the devisees. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Before the passage of the act of 1800,  (2 Littell, 374), there is no doubt but that slaves were assets in the hands of executors for the purpose of paying the debts of their testator; but, as by that act, slaves are made to pass by the will in the same manner, and under the same regulations, as land, since then, upon the decease of the testator, the legal title in the slaves is immediately transferred to the devisee; and consequently as the assent of the executor is not necessary to perfect the devisee's title, the slaves can not now be deemed assets in his hands. Because, therefore, the court below refused to instruct the jury that by the will of the testator of the appellant, made in 1813, his slaves passed to the devise, under the same regulations as landed property, and that they were not assets in the hands of the executrix, the judgment of that court must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. Since the act of 1800, (2 Lit. 374) slaves are not assets in the hands of executors, but vest directly in a devisee, without the assent of the exor: Vide ante, Woodyard's hrs. v.
