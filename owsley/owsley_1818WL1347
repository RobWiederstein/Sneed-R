Jun. 15, 1818. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE MONTGOMERY CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Forcible Entry and Detainer 179 k 9(1) 179 Forcible Entry and Detainer 179I Civil Liability 179k9 Prior Possession of Plaintiff 179k9(1) k. Necessity of Possession. Most Cited  Cases A warrant of forcible entry and detainer cannot be maintained unless the plaintiff hath had possession in fact of the land. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: We are of opinion the verdict of the jury rendered in this case, can not be supported by the evidence set forth in the bill of exceptions. To have authorized the jury to find for Wilson, as he was plaintiff in the warrant, evidence of his being possessed in fact of the land upon which the forcible entry is alleged to have been committed by Stewart, should most indisputably have been produced. A warrant of forcible entry and detainer can not be maintained unless the plaintiff hath had possession in fact of the land. But upon adverting to the evidence, we are of opinion that Wilson is not shewn to have been so possessed, and consequently the court below ought, at the instance of Stewart, to have awarded a new trial. The judgment must, therefore, be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had not inconsistent with this opinion. Bibb, for appellant, Pope, for appellee. Ky.App. 1818.
