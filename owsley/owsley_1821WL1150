Most Cited Cases (Formerly 233k61) A tenant cannot controvert his landlord's title. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: It was, no doubt, correct to exclude from the jury the evidence introduced, by Anderson, to controvert the title of York, from whom Anderson appears to have obtained the possession of the land as tenant. A tenant can not controvert the title of his landlord. The judgment must be affirmed with costs. Bibb for appellant, Crittenden for appellee. Ky.App. 1821. Anderson v.
