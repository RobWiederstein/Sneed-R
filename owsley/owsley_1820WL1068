Jun. 15, 1820. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE MUHLENBURG CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes New Trial 275 k 102(2) 275 New Trial 275II Grounds 275II(H) Newly Discovered Evidence 275k102 Diligence in Procuring Evidence 275k102(2) k. Cumulative and Impeaching Evidence. Most  Cited Cases A new trial will not be granted for newly discovered evidence which only goes to discredit a witness sworn on the trial, and might have been proved by other witnesses who were sworn. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: The only question made in this case by the assignment of errors, involves an inquiry into the decision of the circuit court in refusing to award a new trial. A new trial should not be granted because of the discovery of new testimony, if that new testimony only goes to discredit a witness sworn on the trial, and the fact known to others than the new discovered witness. The new trial was asked for on the ground of a discovery of new evidence. But as the evidence alleged to have been discovered tends barely to discredit witnesses sworn on the trial, and especially as it appears from the affidavit of Clarke, the same matter which the discovered witness is expected to prove, might have been proven by other witnesses, the court decided correctly in refusing a new trial. The judgment must be affirmed with cost and damages upon the damages recovered by Rutledge in the circuit court. Ky.App. 1820. Clarke v. Rutledge 2 A.K.Marsh. 381, 9 Ky. 381, 1820 WL 1068 (Ky.)
