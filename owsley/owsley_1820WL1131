Most Cited Cases The court cannot discharge the surety on a bond given for the due prosecution of a traverse, and thereby render him a competent witness. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Notwithstanding the court, before whom the traverse in this case was tried, made an order discharging the surety in the bond given by Carneal before the justice, for the due prosecution of the traverse, the surety, nevertheless remained responsible; and, as was held at the present term in the case of Jack against Carneal, the security was incompetent to prove any fact conducing to show Carneal's right to recover. Because therefore, Rout, who is security in the bond, was admitted as a witness on the part of Carneal, the judgment must be reversed with cost, the cause remanded, and further proceedings had, not inconsistent with this opinion. The court can not charge the security in a traverse bond and thereby render him a competent witness. Talbot for plaintiff, Hardin and Bibb for defendant. Ky.App. 1820. Holeman v.
