Oct. 8, 1819. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE WARREN CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Pretrial Procedure 307A k 68 307A Pretrial Procedure 307AII Depositions and Discovery 307AII(B) Perpetuation of Testimony 307Ak68 k. Notice of taking. Most Cited  Cases (Formerly 122k56(2)  Depositions) The want of notice of the time and place of taking a deposition excludes the deposition, unless waived by the adverse party. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT:FNa1 FNa1. Absent, Judge Rowan. The record in this cause, containing no statement of facts from which the notice to take depositions can be adjudged reasonable, we are constrained to decide, that Willoughby, by whom the deposition was introduced, failed to shew a right to use it in evidence before the jury, and, consequently, the objection of Rennick to the reading of the deposition, should have been sustained by the court. Unless the record exhibits a reasonable notice of taking a deposition, it should be rejected, if the reading it is excepted to. The judgment must be reversed with cost, and the cause remanded for further proceedings. Hardin for appellant, Bibb for appellee. Ky.App. 1819. Rennick v.
