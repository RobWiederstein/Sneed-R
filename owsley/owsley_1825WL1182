Most Cited Cases In a declaration on a covenant to pay $400 worth of whisky as specified in an agreement, there need not be profert of the agreement. OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. Statement. This writ of error, with supersedeas, is prosecuted by E. & D. Jackson, to a judgment recovered against them in the circuit court, in an action of covenant brought by Sagacer. It is assigned for error-- 1st. That the declaration is defective. Assignment of errors. 2nd. The court erred in giving instructions to the jury. 3d. The court erred in declaring the law upon the demurrer of Sagacer to the plea of the Jacksons. The action is founded on the following covenant, to-wit: "On or before the 31st day of March, 1822, we, or either of us, promise and oblige ourselves, our heirs &c. to pay unto F. Sagacer, or assigns, four hundred dollars worth of merchantable whisky, in good casks, as specified in our agreement of this date, at forty-two cents per gallon, given under our hands and seals, this 7th day of September, 1818." Covenant declared upon. Signed,                                   "ELIJAH JACKSON, Seal. DAVID JACKSON, Seal." The declaration, after setting out the covenant, alleges for breach, that the said Elijah Jackson, and David Jackson, nor either of them, although often required so to do, have not paid the said Sagacer four hundred dollars worth of goods merchantable whiskey, in good casks, or specified in the said agreement, between them, at forty-two cents, nor any part thereof, &c. Assignment of breaches in declaration. The only objection taken in argument to the declaration, and that to which the attention of this court will be exclusively directed, is predicated upon the idea that the agreement alluded to in the covenant upon which the suit is founded, should have been set out in the declaration. If, according to the covenant contained in the declaration, its legal import might be changed by the agreement alluded to, the objection would certainly be entitled to great weight. In that case, it would be difficult to perceive how the court could judge of the sufficiency of the breach assigned, without knowing what stipulations the agreement contains. Where it appears from the instrument declared on, that its legal import might be changed by another writing therein alluded to such writing must be proffered, otherwise not. See  Trustees Perryville v. Letcher, 1 Monroe, 12. But we do not understand from the covenant contained in the declaration, that its import would be effected by the agreement. We understand by the covenant, that the parties had previously agreed upon the terms of their contract, and, as specified in that agreement, the covenant contains a full and complete description of those terms, and stipulates for their fulfilment. *2 In a declaration on a covenant "to pay 400 gallons whiskey in good casks as specified in our agreement of this date at forty-two cents per gallon," there need not be profert of the agreement referred to. Thus understanding the import of the covenant, there certainly was no necessity for the declaration to set forth any other agreement than that contained in the covenant. The objection to the declaration can not, therefore, be sustained. With respect to the other questions made by the assignment of errors, it is sufficient to remark that each of those questions have heretofore underwent the adjudication of this court, and been decided in conformity to the decision of the court below. The judgment must, consequently, be affirmed with cost and damages. Haggin, for plaintiff; Sharp, for defendant. Ky.App. 1825. Jackson v. Sagacer 3 T.B.Mon. 27, 19 Ky. 27, 1825 WL 1182 (Ky.)
