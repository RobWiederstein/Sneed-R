Apr. 22, 1817. *1 If a tenant holds over after the expiration of the lease, notwithstanding it may have been for more than a year and by parol, he cannot contest the landlord's title, and a warrant for a forcible detainer will lie against him. The tenant is estopped from disputing the landlord's right and the holding over of possession constitutes in law a forcible detainer. A notice to quit the possession before the warrant issues, where the tenant holds over adversely to the landlord, is not necessary.

THIS is an appeal from a judgment for restitution rendered in favor of Marshall, on the trial of a traverse to an inquisition taken before a justice of the peace, upon a warrant for a forcible detainer. Marshall, no doubt, from the evidence in the cause, has shown himself entitled to restitution. Mrs. M'Arthur, from whom Harrison obtained the possession, appears to have held the premises as tenant to Marshall; and although the lease was for more than a year, and by parol, yet as she took possession under Marshall, neither she nor Harrison claiming under her, can by contesting Marshall's right, protect that possession. *2 As Harrison is estopped, therefore, from disputing the right of Marshall, it follows that by holding over the possession against Marshall's will, he has in legal estimation forcibly detained the possession, and thereby subjected himself to an expulsion from the premises by a warrant of forcible detainer. Nor was it necessary, as is contended for Harrison, that he should have been notified to quit the possession before the emanation of the warrant: for having as the jury seem to have found, held over adversely to the right of Marshall, it cannot have been essential for Marshall to give him any notice to depart. But as the judgment is for the restitution of more than one acre of ground, it is contended that under the warrant which issued in this case, it cannot be sustained. This objection is taken upon the hypothesis that the warrant issued but for one acre; but from an inspection of the warrant, it is apparent it issued for more. It is true the terms one acre are used in the warrant as part of the description of the premises detained; but those terms are evidently, according to the act under which the proceedings are had, unnecessary; and as they are moreover, explained away by the subsequent description in the warrant, they cannot have the effect contended for. The judgment must be affirmed with costs. Ky.App. 1817. Harrison v. Marshall 4 Bibb 524, 7 Ky. 524, 1817 WL 1083 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
