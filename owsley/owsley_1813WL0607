Dismissal. Most Cited Cases If plaintiff, who succeeds in the common pleas, appeal, and fail to enter his appeal, defendant shall have costs that accrue after the appeal. Opinion of the Court by Judge OWSLEY. *1 DAVIS having commenced an ejectment in the Clarke Circuit Court, but failed to prosecute the same, the Court, on the motion of Welton, ordered it to be dismissed, but failed to give judgment for costs. At a subsequent term a motion was made to amend the judgment by awarding costs, but the motion was overruled by the Court. Costs ought to be given on non pros. in ejectment. That Welton was entitled to his costs expended in his defense to the ejectment, we have no doubt. The Court, on dismissing it, should, as an inseparable incident thereto, have entered judgment for costs; not having done so, the judgment is erroneous and must be reversed with costs; the cause remanded and the action dismissed with costs.
