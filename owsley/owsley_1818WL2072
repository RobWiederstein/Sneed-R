(Cite as: 1 A.K.Marsh. 252,  8 Ky. 252 (Ky.),  1818 WL 2072 (Ky.)) Court of Appeals of Kentucky. May, &c. v. Johnston's Executors. Jun. 13, 1818. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A DECREE OF THE GENERAL COURT. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: These are appeals from a decree of the general court, rendered in a suit in chancery, brought by May, &c., to be released from a judgment at law, recovered against him by Johnston's executors, &c., and the only questions which arise in the cause, involve an inquiry into the propriety of decreeing in favor of the complainants, certain credits which they claim against the judgment at law. As the decision of these questions involves no principle of law, but turns exclusively upon matters of fact, we have not thought it material to go into a detailed statement of the case; but have considered it sufficient barely to observe, that upon an examination of the evidence and exhibits in the cause, we are thoroughly satisfied with the correctness of the decision rendered by that court, both as respects the credits it refused to allow, and those it actually gave. The decree must consequently be affirmed with damages upon the damages decreed in that court. Each party must pay the cost of their respective appeals. Wickliffe, for appellant; Hardin for appellees.
