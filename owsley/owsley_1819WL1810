(Cite as: 1 A.K.Marsh. 557,  8 Ky. 557 (Ky.),  1819 WL 1810 (Ky.)) Court of Appeals of Kentucky. Green Clay v. Isham Fox. Jun. 7, 1819. *1 ON AN APPEAL FROM A JUDGMENT OF THE MADISON CIRCUIT COURT. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: Upon the principle recognized by this court in the case of Kendal and al. against Slaughter, decided at the fall term, 1818, it follows, that no provision, either of the compact with the state of Virginia, or the constitution of this state, or that of the United States, is contravened by the passage of the act of 1808, concerning the limitations of actions in relation to land claims derived from the laws of Virginia. The law limiting the time for bringing suits for land (session acts of 1808, pa. 85, ch. 66), is no infringement of the compact of Virginia. Vide ante, Kendal v. Slaughter, acc. The plea of Fox, therefore, as it contains all material averments necessary to bring his case within the provisions of that act, was properly sustained, and upon overruling Clay's demurrer to the plea, the court correctly rendered judgment in bar of his action. The judgment must be affirmed with cost. Bibb, for appellant; Wickliffe, for appellee. Ky.App. 1819. Clay v. Fox 1 A.K.Marsh. 557, 8 Ky. 557, 1819 WL 1810 (Ky.) END OF DOCUMENT
