Oct. 19, 1817. *1 ON A WRIT OF ERROR TO REVERSE A JUDGMENT OF THE BATH CIRCUIT COURT. West Headnotes Judgment 228 k 240 228 Judgment 228VI On Trial of Issues 228VI(B) Parties 228k240 k. Joint or Several Judgment. Most Cited  Cases It is error to pronounce a joint judgment against three, while a former judgment against one of them in the same action remains unreversed. JUDGE OWSLEY DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT: This court is of opinion that it was irregular for the court below to render a joint judgment against all the plaintiffs in error, in a joint action brought by the defendant in error against them, whilst a judgment in the same action, which had been previously rendered against T. Allen, one of the plaintiffs, continued unreversed and in full force. It is error to pronounce a joint judgment against three, while a former judgment against one of them, in the same action, remains unreversed. For that irregularity, therefore, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings: but as it now appears the judgment first rendered against T. Allen, has been reversed since the obtaining the latter judgment against all of the present plaintiffs, upon the return of the cause to the court below, as T. Allen as well as the other plaintiffs, will be then legally before the court, judgment may be then entered against all, unless they do, by some sufficient plea, present a bar to the action. The plaintiffs in error must recover their costs in this court. Hardin for plaintiffs, Bibb and Talbot for defendant in error. Ky.App. 1817. Fletcher v.
