OPINION OF THE COURT, BY JUDGE OWSLEY. It appearing from the proof and exhibits in the cause, that the title under which Metcalfe recovered the fourteen acres of land from Spears, is paramount to the title of Garrard, and there being no evidence of any fraud having been committed by Garrard in the sale of the land, the extent to which Garrard became liable, upon the recovery of the land by Metcalf, was the consideration money for which he sold the land, and interest, and as by afterwards accepting a deed of conveyance for the land from Garrard, Spears discharged Garrard from the liability under his bond for a title, it is but equitable, and the court was correct in so decreeing, that Spears should account to Durbin for the amount to which Garrard would otherwise have been liable, on account of the recovery of the land by Metcalf, proof having been made that Durbin, from whom Spears obtained the assignment of Garrard's bond for the fourteen acres, had, after the recovery by Metcalf, and before the deed was made by Garrard, settled with Spears for the lost land. Where there is no proof of fraud, the vendor's liability for the loss of the land, is the purchase money and interest. Implied contracts between vendor and vendee. Decree affirmed with costs.
